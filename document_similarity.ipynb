The Jaccard-based similarity analysis below is then only run on the deduplicated version of the corpus to avoid including identical documents in the pairwise display. You can see the names of all identical documents in your corpus by executing the following cell, which allows you to export the relevant table as a CSV file. This table provides the filename of the retained file in the ‘kept’ column and the file names of the relevant identical (excluded) files in subsequent numbered columns. For example, the column ‘1’ contains the file name of the first duplicate of the file in the ‘kept’ column, and so on – this depends on the number of duplicates identified.\n",
