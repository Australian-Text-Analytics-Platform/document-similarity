No sugar, but still a danger
CAFFEINATED energy drinks cause a 25 per cent spike in teenagers' blood glucose and insulin levels even when they contain no sugar, alarming new research shows.
A study to be presented to a world diabetes conference in Vancouver has found the caffeine alone in the drinks could predispose people to diabetes and heart disease.
About 30 per cent of teens and half of all young adults consume the drinks, which have been associated with a handful of deaths worldwide and over 300 health events, including 128 hospitalisations in Australia.
Consumption of the drinks in Australia surged fivefold in the decade to 2010 and some experts are calling for them to be banned from sale to those aged under 18.
Heidi Virtanen, from the University of Calgary in Canada, will tell the conference a study of caffeinated drinks in adolescents found they caused a 20-30 per cent increase in insulin and glucose levels.
The chief concern about energy drinks is the amount of caffeine they contain and the fact they are aggressively marketed to children.
Energy drinks typically contain about 80mg of caffeine.
Deakin University research has found, on average, children first use these drinks at the age of 10 in Australia. Children and adolescents are much more likely to ingest higher amounts of caffeine per kilogram of body mass when they consume these drinks because they are smaller than adults.

Students tested after diabetes kit incident
THE families of four children who pricked their fingers with a diabetes testing kit have sought medical advice.
The Department of Education said the students used the kit in the playground of the East Derwent Primary School.
""The student brought their grandmother's diabetes testing kit to school and, together with three other children, used the finger stick test to prick themselves,"" the department's deputy secretary Liz Banks said.
Ms Banks said the kit was confiscated when a teacher became aware of the incident, which happened last Thursday.
It is believed the students are four girls in Grade 3.
""While the students claim to have changed the head of the finger stick test before each use to be safe, it was recommended to parents that the students involved be taken to the doctor for appropriate follow-up,"" Ms Banks said.
The students' parents were told of the incident, last Thursday and visited doctors. The parents were also asked to confirm the students had had hepatitis B vaccinations.
Acting public health director Mark Veitch said the incident highlighted the importance of never sharing any implements that drew blood.
""The risk of spreading a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV in this setting is extremely low,"" Dr Veitch said.
""It's important for parents to get advice and testing from their general practitioner.""

New mums in denial over weight gain
MUMS are underestimating how much weight they gain while pregnant and are putting themselves at high risk of type 2 diabetes, a conference on diabetes will be told today.
A study of 110 women who developed gestational diabetes while pregnant has found up to 80 per cent were still overweight or obese three months after giving birth.
Despite this, almost half those who were overweight or obese believed they had a healthy weight, says Allison Sigmund, a dietitian and diabetes researcher from the University of Western Sydney (UWS) School of Medicine.
""Self-perception is a major barrier to tackling weight issues and diabetes risk,"" Ms Sigmund said. ""It really is a case of 'I see what I want, not what I should' for many new mums."" The excess weight meant one in three of the women would go on to develop type 2 diabetes within three years.
The disease has serious health complications. In the past decade, 10,000 Australians with type 2 diabetes have gone blind and 20,000 had their limbs amputated. Another 80,000 had heart attacks, 40,000 had strokes and 25,000 were suffering kidney failure and needed dialysis.
The women controlled their blood sugar while they were pregnant to ensure they didn't harm their baby or have birth complications from a large infant, Ms Sigmund said.
""They're doing it for their babies but don't realise afterwards they've got to do it for themselves, otherwise they'll develop diabetes,"" she said.
Around one in five women have increased blood glucose during pregnancy, a condition known as gestational diabetes.
Blood glucose levels often return to normal after childbirth, but failure to reduce excess weight increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
""Approximately 50 per cent of women gain excess weight during pregnancy. This is fuelling rates of gestational diabetes and increasing the number of children who enter the world already on the road to type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr Sof Andrikopoulos from the Australian Diabetes Society.
The study will be presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Australian Diabetes Society & Australian Diabetes Educators Association in Melbourne today.
It found women with an accurate perception of their weight were almost twice as likely to try to lose weight than those with a false perception.

Boy gets world-first diabetes aid
Four-year-old Perth boy Xavier Hames has become the first patient in the world to receive an artificial pancreas as part of his routine diabetic care.
The Princess Margaret Hospital patient is using the breakthrough technology to help manage his type 1 diabetes, based on an automated insulin pump that can predict and respond to low glucose levels.
He is the first to use the pump routinely rather than as part of a clinical trial that has been running for several years.
The research has involved a team of specialists from PMH and hospitals across Australia, funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the Federal Government.
The pump system mimics the biological function of the pancreas to predict low glucose levels and stop insulin delivery, avoiding the consequences of low glucose such as coma, seizure and potential death.
PMH Professor Tim Jones, one of the leading clinicians involved in trials of the device, said it was the first time the hospital had been able to routinely offer patients a tool that could prevent hypoglycaemia.
""The majority of hypoglycaemic attacks occur at night when a person is asleep and they might not be able to react or recognise the attack,"" he said. ""This device can predict hypoglycaemia before it happens and stop insulin delivery before a predicted event.
""This coupled with the fact that the pump automatically resumes insulin when glucose levels recover is a real medical breakthrough.""
Xavier was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 22 months and has been receiving regular treatment at PMH since then. His mother Naomi said the pump system was a breakthrough in Xavier's care.
""Having the pump gives us the reassurance that Xavier is safe,"" she said.

IS YOUR PARTNER SABOTAGING YOUR HEALTH?
We've all had a loved one derail our healthy eating intentions with a cheeky slice of cake here or a chocolate bar there - but according to a Danish study, those treats might be doing more harm than we realised. After assessing the health of more than 6000 men and women, the scientists found men are more at risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their wives are obese, most likely because they eat the same foods as their spouse and share their poor exercise habits. On the flipside, women living with obese men showed no additional increase in risk. Whatever your other half's weight, the study's researchers were quick to point out that your own health is the most significant indicator when it comes to your diabetes risk.

New world of hope for diabetes 
A GROWING number of Australians are living with diabetes but now the efforts of some young sufferers and the aid of new technology are making lives easier.
Seven young Tasmanians were named Diabetes Australia young leaders at a reception at Government House in Hobart last night marking World Diabetes Day.
One of them, Strahan resident Tahlia McDermott, 20, said that with more than 25,000 Tasmanians diagnosed with diabetes and many undiagnosed she hoped the role would allow her to increase community awareness of type 1 diabetes.
""Having type 1 diabetes has given me the opportunity to raise awareness and speak from my own personal experiences as I understand first-hand what it's like to live with the disease."" Ms McDermott said.
She is using a new smartphone app to measure her blood sugar levels technology unimaginable during a fund-raising trip in March.
""I cycled from Vietnam to Cambodia, stopping at local hospitals to meet with other young people living with type 1 diabetes and was fortunate enough to provide them with essential supplies that we have access to in Australia,"" she said.
""They don't have any of the modern technology that we've got, they're still using syringes and urine sampling. We dropped off supplies and toys to brighten up their day.""
How far things have come is demonstrated by an iPhone app.
A blood sugar tester strip is put into an adaptor that fits on to the smartphone, then it ""takes about five seconds"" for IGB Star to measure blood sugar levels.
""I can check my sugar everywhere I go and it keeps the data logged so I don't have to write it down for my doctor it means I can send it straight off to my doctor, she can analyse it and email me straight back if she needs to,"" Ms McDermott said.
""It makes it much easier. I've seen a few glaucometers over the years and some of them have been really big, really chunky and they break easily.
""Everyone's always got their phone on them, so why not have your glaucometer on you all the time.""

Obesity becoming 'norm' as diabetes apathy grows
Victorians' growing weight problem is failing to ring alarm bells on diabetes, the nation's fastest-growing chronic condition.
Fifty-six per cent of the state's population are classed as overweight or obese, but almost half have no concern about developing diabetes.
The widespread apathy was revealed in the AustraliaSCAN report, an annual survey of 2000 Australians.
Forty-seven per cent of Victorian respondents said they had no concern about getting diabetes and felt no need to do anything about it. But 41 per cent admitted eating fast food regularly and 24 per cent did not get enough exercise.
Every day in Australia, 280 people get diabetes. A million people are diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, or the more common and often preventable Type 2, and it is estimated another 700,000 have it but don't know. About 2 million to 3 million Australians have ""pre-diabetes"" and are at high risk of developing Type 2, which can be caused partly by poor lifestyle decisions such as eating too much sugar and not exercising. The disease can lead to heart disease, blindness and kidney damage.
Professor Jane Speight, director of the Australian Centre for Behavioural Research into Diabetes, said acutely life-threatening diseases such as cancer and HIV had pushed diabetes into the background.
Australia's ""obesogenic environment"" contributed to the diabetes risk becoming less obvious, she said.
""As more of us become overweight and physically inactive, that becomes the norm... it becomes a challenge for people to stand up and say 'no, I want to be different to that',"" she said.
Catherine Stirling, a nurse at Melbourne Private Hospital, experienced gestational diabetes during her two pregnancies, and now has pre-diabetes, which means her blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. ""It's really scary when you get those results. Even though I knew I was high-risk [for diabetes], I was still fairly apathetic,"" she said. ""I thought: 'I'm heading down a path of destruction here'.""
Mrs Stirling took dietary and exercise steps to reduce the chance of her pre-diabetes developing into type 2. Nearly two decades on, she's still managing to fend off the condition.
On Sunday, Melburnians are invited to run or walk around the Tan to raise awareness of diabetes prevention. Next week, world experts visit Melbourne for the World Diabetes Congress.

A sweet relief for diabetes 
PARENTS will no longer have to worry about the devastating prospect of their diabetic kids dying through the night with the government today announcing free continuous glucose monitoring kits for children and teens under the age of 21.
The $54 million announcement will see a sticker being placed on the skin of a child or young person with diabetes to estimate blood glucose levels. Alerts will be sent to parents' smartphones when the child's glucose levels become concerning and they can administer insulin immediately.
Currently continuous glucose monitoring kits cost up to $4000 a year, but from tomorrow they will be available to eligible families for free.
There are 15,000 child and teen type 1 diabetics sufferers in Australia. However, it is estimated around 4000 will access the new program.
Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease that attacks a person's ability to produce insulin. Children and young people with the disease have to monitor their glucose levels around the clock.
It's estimated around 10 Australians with type 1 diabetes die each year overnight due to complications relating to their disease. Health Minister Greg Hunt said continuous glucose monitoring would save lives and also reduce the hassle of the daily finger-prick for diabetics.

Weaning the west off a diet of sugar and fat
The Western Sydney Diabetes partnership is considering a wide range of measures to improve the health of the population, including transport options to reduce car reliance, education programs in schools, building more green spaces and better access to fresh food.
But those who designed the plan recognise that without policies at a federal level to drive changes in behaviour, the measures will have limited success.
Mr O'Connor said preventing diabetes would require the same level of co-ordination and bipartisanship as tobacco control, which involved awareness campaigns, taxation measures and regulated advertising.
""If we were a clever society we would apply some comprehensive social engineering to reduce lifestyle-related illness,"" Mr O'Connor said. This could include a sugar tax or raising the GST to encourage people to buy fresh food, which is not taxed.
Diet is considered to play a more important role in weight loss than exercise, though people who regularly exercise are more likely to maintain their weight loss as it improves their metabolism.
University of Sydney metabolic health Professor Stephen Colagiuri said the priority should be preventing people at high risk of diabetes from developing the disease, doing something at a population level to encourage healthier eating and more physical activity and making a concerted effort to prevent pregnant women from developing gestational diabetes.
But attempts to bring these about had not been supported, with little political will to make policies to drive changes in behaviour.
The National Diabetes Strategy Advisory Group suggested to the government a range of measures in 2014, including the appointment of a National Diabetes Commission to implement the plan, but these had been watered down by the government, said Professor Colagiuri.
""We produced a document with advice to guide their national diabetes strategy and they produced a document of their own, but their prevention part is not very strong,"" he said.
""We are at loggerheads with the government in regards to an implementation strategy.""
Health Minister Sussan Ley said the advisory group's strategic plan was moving through an inter-governmental committee.
""It is important to recognise this strategy complements work also under way to develop a treatment approach for a number of chronic conditions, and we expect an Implementation Strategy to be considered by the Council and delivered by the end of this year,"" she said.
What are the odds?
People living in western Sydney are 1 1/2 times more likely to develop diabetes than other parts of Sydney, according to research by Wollongong University public health researcher Thomas Astell-Burt, who mapped the odds ratio of developing diabetes in different parts of Sydney.
People living in Blacktown are three times as likely to develop diabetes as those living in Mosman.
Part of this may be due to the region having higher proportions of Indigenous people, people with mental health problems and people in their childbearing years, who are at higher risk.
But the prevalence of obesity in western Sydney may also be linked to the relative scarcity of fresh food and groceries compared with fast food and a built environment that is less conducive to a healthy lifestyle.
In a separate study, Associate Professor Astell-Burt mapped the food environments in Australian cities, showing that 10 to 20 per cent of Mount Druitt and Blacktown residents residents lived within a kilometre of a takeaway, but did not have access to a supermarket in the same distance.
The concept of ""food deserts"", which was popularised in the US by first lady Michelle Obama, found that some areas had better access to fast food than they did to fresh food.
""Nobody believes that living in an area without healthy choices is a good thing and making sure that we can incentivise greengrocers and supermarkets to open, so people have access to healthy choices, is a good start,"" Associate Professor Astell-Burt said.
""But how do you nudge people to make those healthy choices when they're on their doorstep? So it's only part of the solution.""
Mr O'Connor said social demographic was part of the reason why people living in western Sydney had higher odds of developing diabetes, but that was not the whole story.
""People are more likely to copy the behaviour that they see going on around them and for at least the last two generations there has been an increase in adopting excessive calorie intake.""
Research indicates the current epidemic may be condemning the next generation, with the children of women who developed gestational diabetes 30 per cent more likely to get type two diabetes themselves.

New centre to tackle diabetes

The grant will allow the Telethon Juvenile Diabetes Family Centre being built in Stirling to become the first of its kind in Australia to provide information and services for families of the more than 120 WA children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year.
The funding is part of a wider contribution by Lotterywest which is expected to reach $1.4 million.
The centre is being built by BGC and supported by Lotterywest, the State Government and Telethon.
Health Minister Kim Hames said type 1 diabetes in children was a complex and demanding medical condition.
""Type 1 diabetes not only has an impact on the life of the child diagnosed with the condition, but also has a significant impact on the other members of their family,"" he said.
""The centre will be the first of its kind in Australia and will take a holistic approach that complements the excellent clinical care on offer here in WA.""
The centre, which is due to open early next year, will offer emotional wellness support programs, peer support networks, diabetes education and information, and activities aimed at children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
Chairman of the centre's board Jeff Newman said the grant was timely, with next week being National Diabetes Week. He said type 1 diabetes was a challenging medical condition, with people requiring daily insulin injections, blood tests and dietary restrictions to stay healthy and prevent dangerously high or low blood sugar levels.

New hope in treating old age ills
AN over-the-counter supplement is being tested as a cheap, safe way to treat a wide range of the most common age and lifestyle-related diseases.
Instead of using medication for a single risk factor or disease pathway, Monash University researchers are testing whether carnosine can target the mechanisms that drive several chronic diseases. More than 2000 studies in animals and cells have shown its effects in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia and cancer and delaying ageing.
The first human clinical trials using the supplement will involve 84 overweight and obese adults and 50 people with type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes. Carnosine's effects will be measured on everything from body fat, blood pressure, blood glucose, sleep, depression and cognition.
""Unlike a drug that usually works on one pathway and improves only one risk factor, carnosine actually targets the mechanisms underlying many chronic diseases,"" Associate Professor Barbora de Courten said. ""It's cheap, water soluble and easy to mix into foods."" Carnosine naturally occurs in the muscles, heart and brain of humans and animals but not in large enough quantities for people to get enough through diet. The supplement is already marketed to improve exercise capacity and for its suggested anti-ageing properties.

Nuts get tick from dietitians
Nuts have long been the enemy of anyone watching their weight but now experts believe they can help people slim and beat type 2 diabetes.
An international nutrition scientist speaking at this week's Dietitians Association of Australia's national conference in Perth says nuts have been wrongly maligned as a cause of weight gain.
Richard Mattes from Purdue University in Indiana, who is presenting findings on the brain's ""pleasure"" response to nuts, says that despite nuts being high in fat and energy dense, they help control weight because they make people feel satisfied.
The DAA recommends people have 30g or one-third of a cup of nuts a day, preferably raw, which is about 20 almonds or walnut halves.
Professor Mattes says having up to 40g a day is fine for most people. ""Epidemiological trials reveal no association or an inverse association between the frequency of nut consumption and weight gain, BMI or diabetes risk,"" he said. Clinical trials showed that a moderate portion of nuts, up to 40g a day, did not pose a risk for weight gain.
""Nuts may also be especially useful as a snack because they provide a wide range of nutrients while having little impact on daily energy intake,"" he said.
Professor Mattes said protein-rich nuts were satisfying because they suppressed hunger and people's tendency to snack even when they were not hungry.
This meant people were likely to eat less later in the day - and that made up for about three-quarters of the kilojoules in the nuts.
The cell walls of nuts were also resistant to digestion so up to one-fifth of their energy never became absorbed by the body. Professor Mattes said there was evidence that nuts also played a role in diabetes management because their fat and fibre reduced blood glucose levels after meals.
There was also a link between regular nut consumption and lower markers of insulin production.
According to the Australian Health Survey, 2.3 million people aged 15 years and over were on a diet to lose weight or for another health reason in 2011-12.

Fruit stops diabetes, but junk the juices
An apple a day keeps the doctor away - if you eat it whole
EATING fruit lowers the risk of developing diabetes but drinking fruit juice seems to raise it, a large study suggests.
Blueberries, grapes and apples appear to be best at warding off diabetes, according to research suggesting that swapping juice for whole fruits will lower the risk of the disease.
Scientists suggest this may be because healthy nutrients are lost in the juicing process while sugar is absorbed more rapidly into the blood from liquids.
A team led by researchers at Harvard University looked at three studies that gathered data on 187,000 US nurses. They were asked about their eating habits every four years, and 6.5 per cent of them developed diabetes. People who ate three servings a week of blueberries had a 26 per cent lower chance of developing the disease, they found. Those regularly eating grapes and raisins had a 12 per cent reduced risk, and apples and pears cut the chances by 7 per cent.
People who ate prunes also had an 11 per cent reduced risk of type 2 diabetes after adjusting for other factors.
However, the study found that drinking fruit juice increased by 8 per cent the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
The authors say that swapping three weekly servings of fruit juice for whole fruit reduced the diabetes risk by 7 per cent and more for many fruits. Replacing three servings a week of fruit juice with blueberries cut the risk by 33 per cent, while replacing juice with grapes and raisins cut the risk by 19 per cent.
The risk was also 14 per cent lower if juice was replaced with apples and pears, 13 per cent lower if replaced with bananas and 12 per cent lower if replaced with grapefruit, according to calculations adjusted for people's age and lifestyle.
""Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is associated with a higher risk,"" they write in the British Medical Journal. ""These results support recommendations on increasing consumption of a variety of whole fruits, especially blueberries, grapes and apples, as a measure for diabetes prevention.""
The researchers say these fruits contain a high level of compounds known as anthocyanins, which some research has suggested could protect against diabetes.

Directors raid charity coffers
Diabetes NSW wants to pay board
EXCLUSIVE THE state's leading diabetes charity wants to use donations to pay its directors up to $950 an hour instead of spending the money to help the sick.
At its annual meeting on Tuesday, Diabetes NSW will seek permission to raid $300,000 from its budget to pay its directors, a move that will require the charity to change its constitution.
With its nine directors only required to do between 30 and 120 hours of work a year, the $300,000 translates to between $280 and $950 an hour.
Diabetes NSW sources its revenue from private donors, sponsors and government grants.
A copy of the organisation's agenda for the AGM says the justification for the payment is that ""the workload and demands on the company continues to increase with the growing number of people diagnosed with diabetes"".
The board has been cut from 15 people to nine and in the agenda Diabetes NSW says the pay level is necessary because ""demands made upon directors continue to increase at all levels"".
The agenda states that board members spend 30 to 40 hours a year attending meetings, and most spend another 40 hours a year ""reading"" for their role as board members. Some of those who are on committees for the organisation ""can add an additional 40 to 80 hours of preparation and attendance at meetings"", the agenda says.
""As such, the company has determined that a total remuneration figure of $300,000 should be distributed amongst the board."" If endorsed at Tuesday's AGM it will be the first time in the charity's history that directors have been paid.
A spokeswoman for Diabetes NSW said the growing number of people diagnosed with diabetes made this necessary. ""A problem this size requires a sound and well thought through business response,"" she said.

The latest technology in diabetic care
IF you have diabetes you need to take extra care of your feet. Diabetes sufferers can experience decreased feeling and blood supply to the feet can be reduced. For those with diabetes there is no such thing as a minor cut, graze or bruise on the foot. When the feeling and blood supply to the feet is reduced, it can prevent you from realising you have a cut or blister. Due to the reduced blood supply, simple injuries such as these take longer to heal and can become infected, or worse, gangrenous. The Walking Clinic can assist you with the full range of diabetes foot care, from simple advice on how to inspect your feet daily for any changes, to the best type of footwear and how to protect your feet from injury. The team uses the latest technology for the diagnosis and management of diabetic conditions. The Walking Clinic uses a doppler to establish blood flow and blood pressure to the feet and toes. A neurothesiometer is also used to measure the ability of the feet to respond to sensation. It uses vibration at different levels to do this. Diabetes can cause the nerves to become attacked by the increase in glucose, reducing the ability of the nerve fibres to transfer sensation, which results in neuropathy (loss of feeling). The clinic recommends that you have a six-monthly assessment to detect any changes early before they become a problem. As well as examining your circulation, The Walking Clinic will look for general foot conditions which may lead to future problems and will also work with you to show you how to monitor your own feet in between consultations.

Diabetes study offers hope of no injections
Injecting insulin is a daily occurrence.
A cure for type 1 diabetes is closer than ever after scientists showed they can switch off the disease for six months in animals, which would equate to several years in humans.
Researchers at Harvard University discovered how to make huge quantities of insulin-producing cells; now a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has proven that planting the cells into mice can restore insulin function for a significant time. They hope to try the treatment in humans within the next two years. If it is successful, it could mean the end of daily insulin injections for the 400,000 people in Britain living with Type 1 diabetes: they would just need a transfusion of engineered cells every few years.
""We are excited by these results, and are working hard to advance this technology to the clinic,"" said Dr Daniel Anderson, professor of applied biology at MIT.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin, the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. Too much glucose d can seriously damage the body's organs over time, so sufferers must test their blood-sugar levels throughout the day - by either pricking their fingers to draw blood or using a continuous glucose monitor. While diabetics can keep their glucose levels under general control by injecting insulin, that does not provide the fine-tuning necessary to properly control metabolism, which can lead to devastating complications such as blindness. Around 10 per cent of all diabetes is type 1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, affecting 29,000 young people in Britain.
The Harvard team used embryonic stem cells to produce human insulin-producing cells equivalent in almost every way to normally functioning cells. When implanted in mice, the cells began producing insulin in response to blood glucose levels and were able to maintain blood glucose within a healthy range for 174 days.

 The nation's love affair with junk food and sugary drinks is not just expanding our waistlines. Evidence is mounting that it is also playing havoc with how our brains function and potentially putting people on the path to dementia.
Insulin resistance, a hallmark of diabetes, appears to play a role in the progression of dementia, according to researchers.
And it is this, combined with the discovery that, like the pancreas, the brain produces insulin, that has some experts increasingly convinced that some cases of Alzheimer's disease could possibly be a new form of diabetes, or ""type 3 diabetes"" as it is controversially called sometimes.
Experts say this could have implications for projections of dementia cases into the future, with the predicted wave of new cases - 3 million between now and 2050 - possibly doubling when factoring in the massive rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes.
It is already known that type 2 diabetics have a 50 per cent increased chance of developing dementia.
Insulin is necessary to allow brain cells to convert glucose into energy to function properly, so when there is a dysfunction of insulin in the body it can affect the brain.
But animal studies indicate insulin might have some additional roles in brain cells, according to Alzheimer's Australia national research manager Chris Hatherly.
""Insulin might be associated particularly with clearing out some of the toxic proteins which form in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, but that is a little more speculative at the moment,"" he said.
""This effect has been observed in some studies but we are not sure how or why or to what extent it might apply to humans as well.""
Scientists are now investigating whether treating problems with insulin regulation in the brain could improve people's mental function or possibly stop or reverse damage caused by Alzheimer's disease.
Some animal and lab-based studies had shown improved brain function in brain tissue when insulin was applied and scientists in Seattle have given insulin to patients under controlled conditions and found an improvement in their memory.
Other studies where Alzheimer's patients were given coconut oil also had intriguing results.
Their brains appeared able to metabolise the coconut oil well, compensating for the inability to use glucose.
Professor Ralph Martins, from the McCusker Alzheimer's Research Foundation, said the ""type 3"" hypothesis had been debated for a few years and the evidence to support it was growing stronger.
""Definitely insulin seems to be a major player in this whole story,"" he said.
""We know for example that when you have high insulin levels as a result of the challenges of metabolising glucose, it has an impact on raising the amyloid levels - amyloid is another protein that is toxic to brain cells and builds up in response to high insulin.""
People with a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's known as APOE4 had an altered metabolism of insulin and fat, both of which were associated with cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease, he said
Professor Martins, who is involved in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing investigating which biomarkers, cognitive characteristics, and health and lifestyle factors play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, said diet was an important factor in the development of Alzheimer's.
""What we have done, which is unique in the world, is that we have compared eating habits with the build up of amyloid in the brain,"" he said.
""Those who adhere strongly to the Mediterranean diet tend to have lower levels of amyloid in the brain.""
Conversely, people with diets high in saturated fats and junk food tended to have increased amyloid in their brain.
Dr Martins said it was too soon to say Alzheimer's was ""type 3 diabetes"", but it was, with more evidence, approaching that stage.
One of the world's largest preventative Alzheimer's drug trials, with centres in the US, Russia and Australia, will start in Perth next year, testing low doses of an insulin-sensitising drug currently used by type 2 diabetics.
Dr Hatherly said it was not yet known if treatment and management of diabetes was enough to reduce the known 50 per cent increased risk for type 2 diabetics back to normal levels.
""It is probably fairly likely that appropriate management of diabetes could reduce the risk of dementia to some extent and it does add emphasis to the importance of managing diabetes for anyone who has been diagnosed,"" he said.
There was substantial evidence, independent of the diabetes link, about the impact of diet on the risk of developing either Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia, Dr Hatherly said.
""There have been a few studies that have shown people with an unhealthy diet in their middle life (30-50 years) are around 90 per cent more likely to develop dementia than people with a healthy diet in middle age - that is a cautionary story,"" he said.
Conservative estimates, just taking into account the ageing population, predict three million Australians will develop dementia between now and 2050.
""But if we factored in this massive increase in obesity and the very significant increase in diabetes we could be looking at...possibly even twice that number,"" Dr Hatherly said.

PALEO NO DIABETES ANSWER
DEVOTEES of the paleo diet shouldn't bank on it beating type 2 diabetes, with a leading health researcher warning there is no evidence eating like our ancestors improves the condition.
Obesity is a major factor in developing type 2 diabetes and lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, are effective in reducing the risk.
While the caveman diet involves avoiding processed food and refined sugars, it also involves cutting out important sources of fibre and calcium, such as wholegrains and dairy.
Advocates of the diet, including chef Pete Evans, believe it is an effective way to reduce weight and gain glycaemic control, while some people even claim it can get them off their diabetes medication.
Associate Professor Sof Andrikopoulos, a researcher at the University of Melbourne and president of the Australian Diabetes Society, reviewed all the scientific studies on the diet and the condition. He reported his findings in the Medical Journal of Australia.
""The scientific literature says that the paleo is no better than any other diet in limiting weight gain,"" he said. ""In fact, the evidence is that there is no evidence that this diet is good for diabetics."" He advised that people with type 2 diabetes should consult a health professional before going on any diet.

ACN takes action over agency's 'biased' audits
Disputes: Australian Careers Network has begun legal action against the Victorian government over the cancellation of funding contracts for training, alleging audits conducted by the Department of Education and Training were biased, conducted unfairly and were unreasonable.
The Victorian government suspended payment for, and then cancelled, a contract for the provision of diabetes training with ACN subsidiary Consider This Training in June, without giving any public reason for its decision.
At the time, ACN said the cancellation was due to an inquiry into the diabetes training courses across the sector, and there would be no material impact on the company's financial position.
However, filings made at the Supreme Court of Victoria now show the contract was cancelled because auditors suspected ""there had been fraud relating to CTT or the funds, misappropriation of funds by CTT, or that there has otherwise been misleading or deceptive conduct on the part of CTT in connection with (the funding)"".
The audits included student interviews that found ""a significant number of CTT students advised they had not enrolled and/or participated in the training or assessment claimed by CTT"", the court filings show.
Breaches may have also included reporting students had commenced training units before they had, so that ACN would benefit from earlier payment of government funds.
ACN is now pursuing the Victorian government for damages, claiming the interviews, conducted by third-party consultant Protiviti, were improperly conducted.
The company claims it now has 130 signed and witnessed statutory declarations from students, which directly contradict claims made by the Education Department.
""These declarations are all from students who state they were called in the last two rounds of calls from (persons acting on behalf of the department),"" wrote Robert McGregor, a partner at HWL Ebsworth representing ACN.
""It would seem that these students would therefore encompass the 84 students interviewed."" If successful, the claim would be the largest against a vocational education sector regulator.
It was the Victorian government's cancellation of funding contracts with Vocation subsidiaries BAWM and Aspin that led to the near collapse of the former sharemarket darling.
Finding inappropriate enrolments and low-quality training, the Education Department pulled contracts worth nearly $20 million, sending Vocation's share price crashing. Shares now trade at 8.4c.
Despite the company's contract cancellations, ACN's share price has continued to increase, rising 4c yesterday to close at $2.90.
ACN listed at $1.70 on the ASX late last year, raising $54.4m. The company's chief executive, Ivan Brown, declined to comment yesterday, citing legal action, as did the Education Department.

Blood monitor to help diabetics sleep easier
Families are calling on the government to back a trial and provide funding
Daniella Meads-Barlow would have turned 21 this Friday.
Instead, the week the Sydney teenager started her HSC in 2011, her mother walked into the type 1 diabetic's bedroom to find she had died from complications related to the illness.
Ever since, Mrs Meads-Barlow and husband Brian have been on a crusade to ensure other parents don't have to suffer the same fate, setting up the Danii Foundation in memory of their daughter who was a leader of the Australian Girls' Choir.
The couple will travel to Canberra today to urge Health Minister Sussan Ley to consider a broader trial and funding for continuous glucose monitoring technology, which they believe would have saved their daughter's life, and will improve the quality of life of thousands of Australians living with type 1 diabetes.
The disease, for which there is no cure, affects more than 130,000 Australians, is hereditary and, unlike type 2 diabetes, is not caused by lifestyle factors.
Mrs Meads-Barlow said young Australian type 1 diabetics continued to die from what was commonly known as ""dead in bed"" syndrome, because without CGM technology they were reliant on finger-prick blood tests which were invasive, inefficient, and involved sleep disruptions at night.
The syndrome, also known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia, occurs when an accidental spike in insulin causes blood glucose levels to plunge. ""It's happening every day. There was one death in Nowra last week, and one in Canberra a couple of weeks ago,"" Mrs Meads-Barlow said. ""I don't want any more families to walk the road we've walked."" Diabetes Australia estimates the cost to government of managing a type 1 diabetic is $16,000 a year.
CGM technology costs less than $5000, and Mrs Meads-Barlow believes significant taxpayer funds would be saved with its implementation, due to a reduction in hospital admissions and an increase in quality of life.
The technology takes the form of a disk which is inserted into the stomach and connected to an insulin pump and monitor, allowing for constant readings of the patient's blood glucose levels, and immediate alerts if those levels become dangerously high or low.
Type 1 diabetic Emily Joyner, 18, who works for the Danii Foundation, said the technology had changed her life since she started using it 18 months ago.
""Before I had CGM I was having to test my levels 10-15 times a day,"" she said. ""To be able to see what your body's doing throughout a 24-hour period, where before you could only see a snapshot every time you pricked your finger, is so important."" Ms Ley said the federal government was working with health professionals to manage chronic illness through the development of its National Diabetes Strategy and its recently formed Primary Health Care Advisory Group.

Sugar's infamy builds
It may be that the increased availability of sugar is the primary driver of the global diabetes epidemic now upon us.
A large population study published in PLOS One suggests sugar is a more powerful driver than obesity, ageing and sedentariness.
Obesity is commonly thought to be the main culprit but countries such as France, Bangladesh and Romania have low obesity and high diabetes.
Sugar is everywhere and the Stanford University researchers say a can of soft drink per person per day - equivalent of 628 kilojoules - increases the prevalence of diabetes 1 per cent.
They show decreasing the availability of sugar over time is associated with falling rates of diabetes.
Although their study has limitations and they don't differentiate between different types of sugars, they believe their estimates of diabetes are probably low because so many people in the early stages are unaware of having the disease.

Paleo diet benefits are facing extinction
DEVOTEES of the paleo diet should not bank on it beating type 2 diabetes with a leading health researcher warning there is no evidence that eating like our ancestors ameliorates the medical condition.
Obesity is a major risk factor in developing type 2 diabetes, and lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise are effective in reducing the risk of becoming insulin-dependent.

While a focus on fresh foods and avoidance of processed foods appear consistent with dietary guidelines, Assoc Prof Andrikopoulous said it was often skewed by interpretation with some people promoting a high intake of animal fats.
He found only 23 articles were written about the diet and Type 2 diabetes with only three clinical trials conducted. ""The studies had fewer than 20 participants, one had no control diet and they were all 12 weeks or less so we can't draw any conclusions about the impact on weight gain or glycaemic control,"" he said, adding ""there is no evidence that this diet is good for diabetics"".

Weighty diabetes problem affecting mothers
Mums are underestimating how much weight they gain while pregnant and are putting themselves at high risk of type 2 diabetes a scientific conference on diabetes will be told today.
A study of 110 women who developed gestational diabetes while pregnant has found up to 80 per cent were still overweight or obese three months after giving birth.
Despite this almost half those who were overweight or obese believed they had a healthy weight, said Allison Sigmund a dietitian and diabetes researcher from the University of Western Sydney (UWS) School of Medicine.
""Self-perception is a major barrier to tackling weight issues and diabetes risk,"" Ms Sigmund said.
""It really is a case of 'I see what I want; not what I should' for many new mums,"" she said.
The excess weight meant one in three of the women would go on to develop type 2 diabetes within three years.
The disease has serious health complications.
About 10,000 Australians with type 2 diabetes have gone blind in the last decade; 20,000 people also had their limbs amputated; another 80,000 had heart attacks; 40,000 had strokes; and 25,000 were suffering kidney failure and needed dialysis.
The women worked hard while they were pregnant to control their blood sugar to ensure they didn't harm their baby or have birth complications from a large infant, Ms Sigmund said.
""They're doing it for their babies but don't realise afterwards they've got to do it for themselves otherwise they'll develop diabetes,"" she said.
Around one in five women have increased blood glucose during pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes.
The mother's blood glucose levels often return to normal after childbirth, but failure to reduce excess weight increases the mother's risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
There is some evidence gestational diabetes and excess weight gain during pregnancy increase the child's risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes in later life.
""Approximately 50 per cent of women gain excess weight during pregnancy. ""This is fuelling rates of gestational diabetes and increasing the number of children who enter the world already on the road to type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr Sof Andrikopoulos from the Australian Diabetes Society. The study will be presented to the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Australian Diabetes Society & Australian Diabetes Educators Association in Melbourne today.

'Adult onset' diabetes hits our children
THE number of Queensland children being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes has jumped more than 70 per cent in four years, with basic lifestyle mistakes to blame.
New figures from Diabetes Queensland reveal that 47 children were suffering from type 2 diabetes in 2012.
This had grown to 81 in January this year. The increase has been more severe among children than adults.
Adult cases grew by about 40 per cent.
Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said it was no longer a disease suffered by adults after a lifetime of bad diet and lack of exercise.
Type 2 diabetes was once referred to as ""adult-onset diabetes"" but Ms Trute said teenagers as young as 14 were now being diagnosed.
""I'm very nervous the epidemic is touching our children,"" she said. ""We've had only a smattering of these cases in the past, the odd one."" Ms Trute said the majority of children diagnosed in the past had been genetic cases.
""That's not necessarily the case now and I think we are starting to see the rise of type 2 diabetes in children,"" she said.
""I don't want it to mirror the rise in the epidemic in adults."" About 60 per cent of type 2 diabetes cases are from poor diet and lack of exercise.
She said children needed to be taught healthy habits and then maintain them. ""You walk down the street and see 60 per cent of adults are overweight or obese and that becomes normal because that's the majority.
""I would hate that to be what you see in the playground; that the normal is really large children."" Ms Trute said the figures were a wake-up call to parents that excess weight was dangerous for a child's health.
""You're never cured of diabetes. With type 2, you get to a position where it's managed but every single day you are going to be consumed with it. A 16-year-old kid knowing for the next 70 years he will have to think about diabetes is a massive pressure to be under.""

Diabetes hospital cases on rise
WA's biggest health insurer has had a ""gravely concerning"" increase in members with type 2 diabetes being admitted to hospital, recording almost 9500 extra claims last year compared with three years ago.
HBF has revealed 10 of its members are among the 28 West Australians being diagnosed with the lifestyle-related condition every day.
Last year, the number of affected members making claims broke through 9000, an increase of about 85 per cent on 2012.
A separate program, which tested almost 1800 HBF members in pharmacies last year, found more than 72 per cent were at moderate or high risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the next five years.
Executive general manager of health and wellness Jennifer Solitario said as a result HBF had developed a ""significant focus"" on prevention as the growing cost of expensive and ongoing care put pressure on premiums.
Last year, the fund received 16,966 claims from members with type 2 diabetes, which was slightly down on 2014 but a big increase on 7489 in 2012.
Ms Solitario said about half the cases could be prevented with healthier lifestyle choices.
The pharmacy program allowed health workers to intervene early with at-risk members and HBF also recently started Perth Diabetes Care at its Friendlies Pharmacy in East Victoria Park, which housed a gym, diabetes educators, dietitians and other health workers.
Ms Solitario said it was ""absurd"" that less than 2 per cent of the national health budget was spent on prevention.
HBF, as a not-for-profit fund, only increased premiums to cover claims. But ""as a growing number of our members require ongoing and costly treatment for conditions like type 2 diabetes, it means our premiums need to keep pace"", she said.
The only way to bring down the cost of health care, including health insurance, was for individuals to take responsibility for their health and the system to better manage chronic illness.
""Imagine if the amount spent on treating people with type 2 diabetes - $14.6 billion each year - was invested in solutions that changed the way we behaved,"" Ms Solitario said.

New hope for diabetes Protein discovery may lead to drug
MELBOURNE researchers have discovered a protein that could help prevent overweight people developing type two diabetes.
Monash University scientists believe the protein, which contributes to insulin resistance in people with fatty livers, could be a targeted and treated by a suitable drug.
Up to a third of Australians are affected by non-alcoholic liver disease, putting them at risk of type two diabetes, stroke and heart attacks.
It is more common in the overweight and obese as it is caused by fat building up in the liver cells.
""One of the first things that happens to many when they become obese is that they get a fatty liver, which precedes type two diabetes,"" Monash University physiology department's Matthew Watt said.
Insulin resistance is a precursor to diabetes and occurs when the body does not make enough insulin or becomes resistant to it. But it was unclear how insulin resistance developed and whether a fatty liver was the major culprit.
Researchers at the university's school of biomedical sciences studied obese mice and found their fatty livers secreted a different sub-set of proteins from normal livers.
Prof Watt said they also found that this set of proteins caused insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
They singled out one of these proteins as being particularly important in insulin resistance in mice the first time the protein had been shown to lead to insulin resistance.
""We examined one of these proteins in great detail and found it caused insulin resistance in several tissues.""
They validated the findings by testing the blood of patients with fatty liver disease and found that they had elevated levels of the proteins that correlated with the level of insulin resistance.
Prof Watt said it was not a cure for type two diabetes but if it could be blocked it may improve insulin resistance. The next step was to work out whether blocking the protein in mice could reverse the insulin resistance.
The research, done with scientists in the Netherlands, had been submitted for publication.
It is estimated that more than 950,000 Australians have type two diabetes.

Diabetes rise's link to poor
THE rate of people being diagnosed with diabetes has risen 33 per cent since 2007, and there are growing concerns about a health and wealth connection to the condition.
Roy Morgan data shows a rise of people diagnosed with some form of the ailment each year has increased from 915,000 to more than 1.2 million, driven mainly by Type 2 diabetes, which medics believe can sometimes be prevented by good diet and exercise.
The research indicates people with Type 2 diabetes are twice as likely as the average Australian to be classified as obese and far less likely to participate in regular or occasional exercise.
The data confirms Diabetes Australia findings that age is a factor, with 83 per cent of Type 2 diabetics 50 years or older.
But of more concern is the elevated incidence of Type 2 diabetes among Australians from the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum. More than half of people with the condition are considered to have low education and low incomes, while only 11 per cent are considered well off.
Roy Morgan CEO Michele Levine says the rising number is cause for concern. ""Obviously, this presents a growing challenge to Australia's already stretched healthcare system,"" she said.

Diabetes hope after scientists cure disease in mice
ENDING Australia's diabetes epidemic could be one step closer, with a promising new technique curing the condition in mice.
US scientists announced the breakthrough, which uses a novel approach that may eliminate type 1 diabetes and result in painful insulin injections becoming a thing of the past.
University of Texas Health Science Centre doctors used a virus to introduce insulin-producing genes into the pancreas of rodent subjects.
Professor Ralph DeFronzo said researchers altered cells so they secreted insulin, but only in response to glucose - mimicking the behaviour of the body's beta cells.
This study bypasses the autoimmune system by altering other pancreatic cells so they can coexist with immune defences - unlike beta cells, which are rejected in type 1 patients.
At the moment, type 1 diabetes is treated by monitoring glucose levels and injecting artificial insulin up to four times a day. While technology has made managing the condition easier, a cure has been elusive, until now.
The patent's co-inventor, Professor Bruno Doiron, said the results had never been seen. ""It worked perfectly,"" Dr Doiron said.
""We cured mice for one year without any side-effects."" Dr Doiron predicted the same low-risk response in humans. While it's early days, the potential applications are promising and researchers will now conduct a study on larger animals before any move to human trials.

Winter's bubs lift risk of diabetes 
WOMEN whose babies are conceived in winter are more likely to develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy, new University of Adelaide research reveals.
The study, which investigated more than 60,000 births in South Australia over five years, is the first of its kind confirming a seasonal variation in gestational diabetes.
It is still largely unknown why there is an increased risk, however, previous studies have suggested physical activity, diet and vitamin D levels are risk factors for the condition.
Gestational diabetes is a serious pregnancy complication that can lead to premature births and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
The study, led by the university's Robinson Research Institute and published in the journal BMI Diabetes Research & Care, found that: FROM 2007-11 the incidence of pregnancies affected by gestational diabetes increased, with 4.9 per cent of pregnancies affected in 2007, but 7.2 per cent in 2011.

MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH Snails to hold key for diabetics 
A SEA snail with potent venom is helping scientists develop ""ultra rapid-acting"" insulin for better diabetes treatment.
Flinders University research shows the ""cone snail insulin"" works on the human insulin receptor.
Medical biochemistry Associate Professor Briony Forbes says the next step is to ""tinker with the molecules"" and create make better insulin for the treatment of diabetes.
""More rapid-acting insulin is the thing we're trying to work towards, so we improve everybody's blood glucose control,"" she said.
""That's something a lot of people are working on and now we have an edge, because we've got a clue as to how we might be able to do that from the cone snail insulin."" Insulin given to humans for therapeutic purposes was originally isolated from the pig pancreas, Associate Professor Forbes said.
These days, human insulin is made in bacteria or yeast: ""You make it in culture and isolate the protein and purify it, that's what we give patients,"" she said.
""We could do the same thing with cone snail insulin, we could make it in bacteria or yeast and incorporate novel properties of cone snail insulin... and make them more fast acting... so we wouldn't be farming cone snails, we would just be applying the knowledge to the production of the better insulin."" But it will take some time - ""at least five years"" - to implement the discovery, Associate Professor Forbes said.
Writing today in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, the researchers describe how ""insulins in the venom of certain fish-hunting cone snails facilitate prey capture by rapidly inducing hypoglycaemic shock"".
The sudden drop in blood glucose levels makes the snail's prey slow down, Associate Professor Briony Forbes said.
""Lowering blood glucose makes them go all slow, so the snails have time to catch them,"" she said.
Earlier research on a wide range of cone snail insulin was narrowed in the latest study to focus on one, Conus geographus G1 (Con-Ins G1), ""the smallest known insulin found in nature"". With collaborators in Melbourne and the US, the research team determined the structure of the cone snail insulin and showed how it worked so quickly. Associate Professor Mike Lawrence from Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research said human insulins could be considered ""awkward"" by comparison.

But tea, coffee and juice drinkers can take heart, because it turns out some sweetened drinks are better than others.
Soft drinks, cordials and sweetened milk were found to contribute to higher type 2 diabetes risk, while sweetened coffee and tea and fruit juice do not.
A Cambridge University study published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, found replacing a serving of soft drinks with a serving of water or unsweetened tea or coffee, cuts the risk of diabetes by 14 per cent.

Study participants recorded everything that they ate and drank for seven consecutive days and over 11 years 847 study participants were diagnosed with new cases of type 2 diabetes.
Every time you increase your consumption of sweet drinks by five per cent of your total energy intake, you increase your risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 18 per cent, the study found. If sweet beverage consumers reduced their intake to below two per cent of their total energy intake, 15 per cent of incident diabetes might be prevented, the research found.

Mother's new helper
PARENTS of children with Type 1 diabetes live in constant fear of a low blood sugar attack that could send their child into a coma but new technology has come to the rescue.
A device called Tidepool can now collect the blood sugar readings from the child's insulin pump, perform continuous glucose monitoring tests and measure activity trackers like FitBit and upload them to the cloud.
It will allow parents and doctors to obtain reports that see patterns in a child's insulin levels connected to sport, birthday parties, eating times and restaurant visits, allowing them to better predict how much insulin a child will need around these events.
Currently none of these devices speak to each other and trying to cross-reference reports from them can be time-consuming and confusing.
Eventually the information will allow parents to be alerted via a watch or a mobile phone when their child's blood sugar readings are crashing.
And experts hope it could advance the development of an artificial pancreas where a continuous glucose monitor could be linked to an insulin pump and automatically adjust a patients insulin levels.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is enthusiastically working with Tide-pool on the new technology.
""Anything that makes the management of such a difficult disease easier is a great benefit,"" JDRF chief executive Mike Wilson said.
The initiative is the work of a group of interested parents who have formed a not-for-profit organisation, Tidepool, to get diabetes device manufacturers to release their data so it can be shared with data from other device companies.
Around 20 Australian parents are believed to be using the system. More than 122,000 Australians suffer from Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by the immune system turning on itself and destroying the body's ability to produce insulin, which allows the body to process sugar and create energy.
Hypoglycaemia, (low blood sugar) which can lead to a coma, can be caused by not eating enough, more exercise than usual or too much insulin.

DETECTIVES are investigating whether a diabetic Sydney boy who died after undergoing ""slapping therapy"" on the advice of a self-proclaimed Chinese healer was also taken off insulin.
The family of seven-year-old Aidan Fenton were attending an $1800 week-long workshop at the Tasly Healthpac Centre in Hurstville when he died.
Police have spoken to a Chinese therapist who advocates the use of slapping therapy until patients are bruised to cure illnesses and rid the body of poisons.
Hongchi Xiao, who hosted seminars at the workshop, has since left the country. It is understood Mr Xiao has claimed participants in the seminar were asked to fast for three days and to undertake the slapping and stretching exercises that can prompt vomiting and dizzy spells, known as a ""healing crisis"".
Aidan was among those vomiting during the seminar.
He has claimed Aidan looked well during the seminar and had eaten rice but became seriously ill during the evening after he had gone to dinner.
Police and paramedics were called to the nearby Hurstville Ritz Hotel where the Year 1 student had been staying with his parents after he was found unconscious at 9pm on Monday.
Hotel staff said they rushed to the family's aid after hearing screams coming from their room.
Aiden was found in bed. His heart stopped beating on the way to the hospital. Police are now investigating if the ""healer"" advised his parents to take Aidan off insulin and instead encouraged alternative therapies to treat him, including massages and slapping.
Detectives questioned Mr Xiao before he left the country and spent yesterday taking statements from witnesses.
Homicide Squad police were notified of Aidan's death but the investigation has been left to local police from St George local area command.
Mr Xiao had been in Sydney following a tour of New Zealand to promote his ""PaidaLajin"" therapy, which involves slapping the body until it bruises to ""unblock meridians and drive out poisons"".
He has written several books on Chinese medicine and travelled the globe spruiking his slapping therapy.
""The greater the pain and bruises while slapping means there is more poison inside the body,"" he told a seminar in South Africa last year. ""You can be your own doctor. We were all born with a self-healing power but we simply ignore it and spent millions of dollars paying for medications. Nature heals, doctors are only assistants."" In 2011, Taiwanese authorities kicked Xiao out of the country and fined him $US1600 for violating medical regulations.
In the same year relatives of a liver cancer patient complained to police after they paid $A4000 to attend Xiao's therapy sessions only for him to die three months later, according to reports in the Chinese media.
Neighbours of the Fenton family described Aidan as a ""beautiful, really good boy"" and said his parents had been too traumatised to speak about the incident.
""All we can hear is them crying, all the time,"" said a neighbour, whose daughter was the same age as Aidan and played with him over the school holidays.
""They were such good parents, it's really hard to understand why it happened and how it happened."" Aidan's death will be referred to the Coroner, who will then decide whether there is evidence of medical malpractice.

Senator on his bike to raise diabetes funds
When ACT Liberal senator Zed Seselja cycles 80 kilometres through the Barossa Valley, it will be children like Ethan Jeffress who keep him motivated. Senator Seselja will join more than 350 cyclists in the Ride to Cure Diabetes on January 17. They will ride either 35, 80 or 160 kilometres to fund medical research to find a cure for type 1 diabetes. He hopes to raise $3500 for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. ""I've gotten to know a lot of families who deal with type 1 diabetes and it is, I think, a very tough and very challenging condition to deal with for a family,"" he said. ""The work JDRF does in looking for a cure but also in supporting families through those difficult times is just really valuable, so to be able to raise a small amount of funds for JDRF along with many others will hopefully make a difference."" Florey mother Kathryn Jeffress' three-year-old son Ethan was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes nearly two years ago. Type 1 diabetes typically affects young people and destroys the body's ability to produce insulin.
The condition requires multiple injections daily or continuous infusion through a pump as well as six to eight finger-prick tests. Mrs Jeffress said Ethan first started showing signs of being unwell shortly after the birth of her third child Mia. He developed diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening complication. ""When it's as severe as Ethan's was, it can be life-threatening and we nearly lost him. It was terrifying,"" Mrs Jeffress said. ""It was a horrible, horrible time, his diagnosis. As a teacher, I had dealt with a handful of kids that had type 1 and I knew what we were going to be up against... I kind of knew that it meant a lifetime of needles and finger pricks and constant worry."" Ethan has an insulin pump and needs a cannular insertion every three days. He also needs 8-10 finger pricks daily, including in the night. ""Having to hurt your own child every day is without a doubt the hardest thing,"" she said. She said her son was incredibly brave. ""I want type 1 to be type none,"" she said. ""In 100 years, we might be in that place but right now we need the research and resources."" For more information, visit: jdrf.org.au.

Diabetes limb loss avoidable
EACH day 12 Australians with diabetes lose entire limbs and parts of their feet in largely preventable amputations.
Not only does the surgical intervention reduce the quality and length of patients' lives, it is also a significant burden on the health system.
At least 85 per cent of amputations are preventable.
Poor blood flow means that for a diabetic, a stubbed toe or ulcer can quickly turn into a wound that doesn't heal and eventually requires an amputation of all or part of the foot, Diabetes Australia CEO Greg Johnson said.
""It's a staggering number: 4400 amputations every year in Australia and that's just the tip of the iceberg because there are also more than 10,000 admissions to hospitals for diabetic foot problems,"" he said.
Prof Johnson said a lack of a nationally consistent approach to the issue or earlier treatment is largely to blame.
Each year there are 1108 amputations, 1450 in NSW and 821 in Queensland on type 1 and 2 diabetes patients.
The Australasian Podiatry Council said diabetic foot disease also cost the health system $875 million each year. Each lower limb amputation is estimated to cost the system at least $26,000.

Pump find for type 1 diabetes
A world-first study at Princess Margaret Hospital has found a way to prevent life-threatening seizures and comas in children with type 1 diabetes.
Professor Tim Jones and his team have shown that potentially fatal episodes of low blood sugar, or hypoglycaemia, can be avoided through the use of a pump that delivers and suspends a supply of insulin in type 1 diabetes patients.
While other insulin pumps are equipped only to deliver insulin, the pump used in the PMH study can identify and suspend the supply of insulin when a patient's blood sugar level becomes dangerously low.
The study found that this new function, known as low glucose suspend, allowed the body to recover before a potentially fatal seizure or coma.
Professor Jones said it had the potential to save lives, particularly in situations where a patient's ability to recognise and prevent a hypoglycaemia attack was limited.
The findings were published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association this week.

Obesity is not a joke
SHEDDING the kilos has cost comedian Brad Oakes half of his best material.
Just over a year ago his pants were 7XL and resembled a tent but, after a health scare, he has trimmed more than 50kg and now wears a standard XL. More importantly, he also is in remission from the diabetes that was threatening his life.
While it has come at a cost to his comedy material, Oakes is happy to laugh at the price.

""When they talked about how diabetics often have their feet amputated, I decided I was short enough.
""I was eating very bad food and drinking a fair bit after work, and after work for me is midnight.""
In February 2011 Oakes' back was so sore he consulted a doctor, only to be told he had diabetes. He was sent to the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, which this week is opening its Weight Assessment and Management Clinic to offer severely obese Victorians services including drug and surgical options, rather than quick fixes with few results.

An Apple a day to help keep the pain away for diabetics 
APPLE'S next big thing could be great news for the 1.75 million Australians with diabetes.
In a move welcomed by experts, the notoriously secretive tech giant's next big thing is rumoured to be a device that can measure blood sugar levels without the need for a painful finger prick.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook set tongues wagging when he announced he was wearing a prototype device and the company has hired a bunch of bio-engineers with expertise in the area.
Little is known about the device but it may use optical sensors to shine a light through skin to measure glucose.
Apple is not the only player in this field. Three years ago Google unveiled a prototype contact lens that could test for sugar levels, though it has not yet brought it to market.
And closer to home, Brisbane-based medical firm Glucotek recently lodged a patent for smart earrings that work as non-invasive blood glucose monitors.
The company is currently finalising a prototype and last month was named the winner of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology entrepreneurial boot camp involving 6000 applicants from 30 countries.
Dr Sof Andrikopoulos, head of the Metabolism Research Group at the University of Melbourne and the president of Australian Diabetes Society, called the need for the frequent finger pricks one of the ""biggest psychologically painful things"" for people managing diabetes.
""Having any way of measure blood glucose or blood sugar without needing to prick your finger to get that little bit of blood is a huge leap (and will) advantage progress in management of diabetes,"" Dr Andrikopoulos said.
""The next step is to get to the point where you can do it non-invasively - that you could measure it without needing to insert something into your skin. Once we get to that point it is going to be absolutely huge.
""It's going to revolutionise the way we understand diabetes. It's going to revolutionise the way that we treat it."" But Diabetes Australia consumer manager Renza Scibilia, who has type 1 diabetes, warned that while technological advances were welcome, they would remain cautious. She said unless any device could be proven to have an accuracy level suitable for a medical device, it would only be considered an activity tracker that provided health trend data rather than absolutely accurate readings.

Painless new diabetic test
THE painful ordeal of pricking a finger for a blood test may be over for hundreds of thousands of diabetics thanks to a new medical device being launched today.
Rather than having to regularly test a drop of blood - for some diabetics up to eight times a day - patients will instead wear a sensor the size of a 20c coin on their upper arm with a small 5mm filament going under the skin.
The sensors can be worn for up to two weeks at a time to monitor blood sugars, which can drop to dangerously low levels or shoot up too high in diabetics.
Diabetes NSW chief executive Sturt Eastwood (pictured), who has been trialling the stick-on device for the past month, said it was a huge step forward.
""I estimate I saved 140 finger lances over a fortnight,"" Mr Eastwood, 52, from Wollstonecraft, said. ""I actually have a lot of scar tissue, calluses on my fingers (from testing over the years)."" Mr Eastwood was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 46 and also has to inject himself with insulin up to four times a day.
He says he usually has to check his blood sugar levels before driving or attending meetings, and the current method of drawing blood and using test strips created hygiene issues when he was away from home.
""About 350,000 Australians have type 1 diabetes and another 850,000 or so have type 2, so this will make a big difference,"" he said.
""For some people the pain of the blood test actually prevents them doing a daily check.
""The other relevant thing is that the sensor actually gives you more information. You pass a wand over it and I was able to take a chart of the results to my doctor."" Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic condition in Australia and has been described by health authorities as a ""silent pandemic"".
Earlier this year the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved glucose monitoring device FreeStyle Libre for Australian use after it went on sale overseas.
Dr Christy Sankoorikal, from Newcastle's Diabetes Management Centre, said some patients were reluctant to prick their fingers.
""This device will help them manage,"" he said. Some diabetics were worried about having a ""hypo"" (low sugar levels) and collapsing while driving or working, Dr Sankoorikal said, so a way of continuously monitoring their glucose levels would help them especially.

Insulin link to disease cures
MELBOURNE researchers are designing new drugs to target insulin resistance in the brain, amid the emerging theory that Alzheimer's disease is a ""Type 3"" diabetes.
The cracking of a 30-year mystery into how insulin connects to its receptor to regulate the use of energy in the body, is leading Walter and Eliza Hall Institute scientists to believe insulin could play a powerful role in new treatments for dementia, cancer and diabetics.
A $1 million research project, led by Associate Professor Mike Lawrence, is using knowledge of the intricate insulin receptor workings to focus on three different disease areas.
The WEHI research team last year discovered how the insulin hormone connects
to the insulin receptor to initiate the use of glucose in the body. The breakthrough raised hopes it could lead to the development of medications to replace the need for daily insulin injections.
""...we've got a discovery here that has possibilities for utilisation in three major diseases,"" Associate Prof Lawrence said.
""We've now got the tools and knowledge to bring together all these threads.""
Associate Professor Lawrence said there was growing evidence that Alzheimer's disease could be a ""Type 3"" diabetes, with studies showing that plaque build-up in the brain could bind to the insulin receptors. This left dementia patients unable to respond to insulin properly and caused cognitive decline.
There are clinical trials under way in the US to deliver insulin directly to the brain of Alzheimer's patients through nasal sprays.
""It's an interesting idea. They have looked at brain tissue and discovered you're getting insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease,"" he said. ""We've thought that while we are designing new drugs that are affecting the insulin receptor, there are possibilities in this field as well for another application for insulin.""
Backed by a National Health and Medical Research Council grant, the team is also working on designing drugs to stop cancerous growth caused by the insulin receptor molecule, for malignant tumours such as breast, prostate, pancreas and also colorectal.

Sarah has something missing, but it's not courage
IT took four years for doctors around the globe to work out how Sarah Innes became the only Australian child born without a pancreas, but the beautiful mystery of how she continues to thrive against the odds still amazes her family.
As they battled to save Sarah from neonatal diabetes when she was born in 2009, Royal Children's Hospital doctors were stunned to discover her missing pancreas.
As Sarah became the youngest person ever fitted with an insulin pump to keep her alive, her mother, Karina, sent DNA samples to Chicago experts in the hope they might come up with a diagnosis.
The RCH team also sent samples to researchers in Exeter in the UK - and last year it all paid off when the scientists identified a gene called GATA6 in 15 children born without a pancreas.
Ms Innes is now in contact with the families of the other GATA6 children in New Zealand, Romania, Germany, the UK, US and Canada.
But while she is relieved to finally have a diagnosis and others to talk to, the condition is so rare doctors have little idea what the future holds.
""When she went home no-one expected that she would make her first birthday, then her second birthday - and those first two years were really tough,"" Ms Innes said.
""She is off to school next year and it is a miracle. She is very bubbly, very cheeky and she lights up a room.""
RCH paediatrician Dr Daryl Efron said Sarah's medical situation is extremely complicated, though she has become more stable in the past year despite recently suffering from epilepsy.
""She has done better than we expected - she is a tough kid,"" Dr Efron said.
Ms Innes plans to take Sarah to meet the international experts who discovered her condition when they gather for a conference discussing the breakthrough in Chicago next month.
While the University of Chicago is covering accommodation and attendance, Ms Innes is fundraising for flights.

Fat mums at risk of Type 2 diabetes
MUMS are underestimating how much weight they gain while pregnant and are putting themselves at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, a scientific conference on diabetes will be told in Melbourne today.
A study of 110 women who developed gestational diabetes has found up to 80 per cent were still overweight or obese three months after giving birth.
Despite this, almost half those who were overweight or obese believed they had a healthy weight, said Allison Sigmund, a dietitian and diabetes researcher from the University of Western Sydney School of Medicine.
""Self-perception is a major barrier to tackling weight issues and diabetes risk,"" she said.
""It really is a case of 'I see what I want; not what I should' for many new mums."" The excess weight meant one in three of the women would go on to develop Type 2 diabetes within three years.
The disease has serious health complications, including blindness, risk of limb amputation, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. Despite all, the women worked hard while pregnant to control their blood sugar to not harm their baby or have birth complications from a large infant, Ms Sigmund said.

Diabetes 
What is it?
A chronic condition where there is too much sugar in the blood because the body does not make insulin or does not use what it makes properly.
Risk factors
Poor diet
Obesity
Family history
Sedentary lifestyle
What the experts say
Diabetes WA chief executive Andrew Wagstaff said people underestimated the destructive nature of diabetes.
""We are now riding a diabetes tsunami,"" he said. ""The prevalence has more than doubled since the 1980s and is set to continue. Many people see diabetes as an isolated condition, but diabetes affects the whole body and is often the hidden cause of many other problems.""
Mr Wagstaff said myriad factors contributed to the diabetes problem and frustratingly, many could be avoided.
""From the marketing of unhealthy foods to children, to poor urban planning, there is a growing list of reasons why type 2 diabetes is increasing,"" he said. ""Currently there are more than 2 million Australians at high risk of developing diabetes, but... type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented by up to 60 per cent by adopting a healthy and active lifestyle.""
A lot of work had been done to deal with the problem but more was needed.
""We've eradicated some of the most devastating diseases known to man, and now, for the first time, today's children may not live as long as their parents because of preventable disease. Chronic disease, especially diabetes, is now our biggest threat,"" he said.
The prediction
Mr Wagstaff said there were some developments on the horizon for treatment but prevention was vital and comprehensive strategies were urgently needed to ensure that the current diabetes epidemic was under control in 20 years' time.
""We are seeing the development of things like the artificial pancreas, which will make the management of type 1 diabetes a whole lot easier,"" he said.
""Australian researchers are some of the world's best and we continue to discover more about this complex condition.""
'Now, for the first time, today's children may not live as long as their parents because of preventable disease.'

Thirst, frequent urination, lethargy, weight loss or, conversely, weight gain are all signs a diabetes diagnosis may be imminent.
Type 1 symptoms usually come on suddenly with the time between onset and diagnosis only days or weeks. Type 2, however, can be harder to discern and is often detected incidentally, according to Diabetes WA's Helen Mitchell.
Accounting for about 90 per cent of diabetes, type 2 was often discovered when people went to their doctor for a check-up or they went to their optometrist for a new prescription because their eyesight had become blurry.
""The symptoms can be mistaken for getting older: blurred vision and needing new glasses, being tired, being a bit restless... but people don't put two and two together,"" Ms Mitchell said.
In type 1 there is a sudden, dramatic weight loss as the body chews up its energy sources because the pancreas has stopped producing the insulin needed to aid the storage process. Onset is a medical emergency requiring a hospital admission.
Those with type 2 are more likely to gain weight.
Gestational diabetes can arrive with no symptoms, however some women may experience signs similar to type 1 and 2.

Parent warns of risk to children in special schools without nurses
The father of a student who requires constant help to manage his diabetes has demanded nurses be permanently on site at Canberra special schools to respond to emergencies. John Hillier said he had to fight hard to have a nurse placed at The Woden School after his son started in 2011, and was disappointed this year's trial of a new healthcare model had left school staff to call a nursing hotline.
""Our son's highly unstable type1 diabetes can go from blood glucose levels of 20-plus to two in the space of 15-20 minutes... without signs,"" he said. ""If he goes to two he's considered hypoglycaemic and that affects his brain and his body shuts down. ""When there is a crisis you need the experience and knowledge of a registered nurse to be able to act, and act promptly."" Mr Hillier said these sharpest drops in glucose - requiring immediate injections - occurred about once every six months. ACT Health's Canberra Hospital and Health Services deputy director general Ian Thompson confirmed on Wednesday on-site nursing services would return to two special schools where they had been removed as part of the trial, which the Sunday Canberra Times understands to be Black Mountain and The Woden School. With a review of the Healthcare Access in Schools program under way, he would not guarantee no further changes to special schools' nursing arrangements. Opposition education spokesman Steve Doszpot said permanent, full-time nurses were vital for all four ACT special schools. ""We're talking about children's lives, and parents' state of mind, if you're already worrying enough about your kids,"" he said. Health Minister Simon Corbell said he had instructed his directorate to work with parents and schools to respond to the concerns raised.

Insulin discovery could change the lives of diabetics
Researchers at Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute are looking for corporate backers after making a discovery they say could change the lives of millions of diabetes sufferers - even substituting tablets for insulin injections - and potentially generate big profits.
The institute's 22-year-old research program has triumphed by figuring out how insulin - a hormone which has to be given to diabetics because they lack it - interacts with cells.
""What we are talking about is two molecules, insulin on one hand and the molecule to which insulin binds, the insulin receptor,"" institute researcher Mike Lawrence said. ""The binding effect tells the cell to take up sugar from the blood.
""What we have discovered is a 3D picture of how they interact at the atomic level,"" Dr Lawrence said.
Diabetes has two major variants. Type 1 diabetes tends to strike the young and is believed to be genetic in nature. It has no known cure. Type 2 is more common. It often strikes adults and lifestyle is a major contributing factor. It also has no known cure but can sometimes be managed via diet and exercise. Type 2 is growing in prevalence as obesity rates increase.
The research could help with the development of new varieties of insulin, with the possibility of an end to injections.
The institute has intellectual property protections over its discovery, and stands to benefit as the discovery is applied.
Dr Lawrence has been in discussions with major international pharmaceutical companies.
""They are interested, they have invited me over to talk,"" he said. But a start-up company in the US state of Ohio could be best placed to make the most of the discovery.
""We have a collaborator in the US, Professor Michael Weiss, who is actually chief scientific officer of a company called Thermalin,"" Dr Lawrence said. ""They are very interested in the designs of novel insulins."" Possible projects are insulin that does not need refrigeration, which would be useful in the developing world, and less frequent injections.
Diabetes Australia clinical adviser Jenny Gunton told ABC Radio's AM the discovery had also brought a possible tablet to treat diabetes one step closer.
""I think that this is like the $64 billion prize for a drug company, if it can develop a tablet to mimic insulin. So I don't know how difficult it will be, but I think most drug companies that work in the field of manufacturing insulins will be on this as soon as they can,"" Dr Gunton said.
The discovery could also be used against Alzheimer's and cancer, Dr Lawrence said. Insulin resistance in the brain is implicated in Alzheimer's, and tumour growth may be promoted by certain molecules bonding to cells' insulin receptors.
The research, published in Nature on Thursday, was completed with an international group of collaborators but relied heavily on the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne, with its intense light, to look closely at the micro-structure of insulin.
Dr Lawrence said efforts to turn Melbourne into a biotech hub were working and it would have been hard to do the work elsewhere in Australia. ""The Melbourne environment is extremely conducive to doing this type of high-level research.""
The research also drew on the CSIRO to get insulin molecules into a shape that can be seen by the synchrotron, and a separate federal government-funded body to help make insulin receptor molecules.

Little Isla makes medical history
Four-year Perth girl Isla Robinson has just made medical history, becoming the first person in the world to receive cord blood to hopefully prevent type 1 diabetes.
It is a race against time to try to stop her body from producing the antibodies that can lead to the autoimmune disease that affects her two siblings.
Three days ago, Isla was injected with blood from her umbilical cord that had been stored since birth, after she was selected from 100 children being screened in a ground-breaking trial by Sydney's Kids Research Institute at the Children's Hospital at Westmead.
Researchers are testing the theory that the unique immune cells found in cord blood, regulatory T-cells, can reboot the immune systems of people at higher risk of diabetes because of a family history.
With a 19-year-old half- brother diagnosed with the condition, Isla and her seven-year-old sister Ruby were assessed for the trial 18 months ago because both were showing antibodies that suggested diabetes could be developing.
But within days of their tests, Ruby was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, so doctors turned to Isla. Their mother Rachel Weldon said the family was managing Ruby's condition but hoped the decision to store the girls' umbilical cords with private cord blood bank Cell Care would pay off.
""We're so grateful that even though we're in Perth, we've had the chance to be part of this trial in Sydney,"" Ms Weldon said.
""We found out in January Isla had gone from having only one marker of type 1 diabetes the year before, to having three. We were told it was pretty definite she would get diabetes sometime in childhood.""
Lead researcher Maria Craig said the treatment was straightforward, similar to a blood transfusion, so Isla's recovery was quick.
""We will be checking her blood every three months initially to see if the antibodies go away, which would be fantastic, and if they don't, there may be other changes to her immune system,"" Professor Craig said.

Babies may hold key to diabetes 
NEWBORN babies could help scientists pinpoint the triggers of type 1 diabetes. T he biggest study of its kind in the southern hemisphere will investigate why prevalence of the autoimmune disease has doubled in the past 20 years.
Royal Melbourne Hospital researchers are part of the national team investigating whether exposures during pregnancy - such as the mother's nutrition, diet or microbes - could explain why some babies develop the disease and others do not.
In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the pancreas cells that produce insulin, which regulates the conversion of sugars in food into energy.
RMH diabetes and endocrinology director Professor Peter Colman said he believed that environmental exposures during pregnancy through to early childhood could be the key to understanding the development of the disease. Prof Colman said more than 122,000 Australians suffer from type 1 diabetes, but the incidence increases by 3.2 per cent a year.

Diabetes on rise as idea of sporting nation dies
Young and middle-aged men and women are getting fatter as the country struggles to deal with an explosion in the number of people with diabetes.
But a special snapshot of the nation's health, to be released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, shows many Australians have decided to abandon smoking and cut back on drinking alcohol.
The bureau, which surveyed 19,000 Australians, found that 15.3 per cent of the population, or 3.5 million people, now had arthritis.
The number of people with asthma continues to grow, with more than 2.5 million having the condition, while 17.5 per cent of the population has a mental or behavioural condition.
The biggest health threat, however, remains our flabby stomachs, thighs and buttocks.
Bureau health director Louise Gates said there were 6.3 million adults overweight and a further 4.9 million who were obese.
""Overall, more men are overweight or obese than women and children aged five to 17 remain at about 27 per cent,"" she said.
The bureau noted that while the proportion overall has been steady over recent years, there has been substantial increases among certain groups.
In the mid-1990s, about 37 per cent of men aged between 18 and 24 were overweight. Now the proportion is almost 44 per cent.
And there have been sharp increases in the proportion of overweight men aged in their 30s, 40s and 50s.
Almost 60 per cent of women aged between 35 and 44 are now overweight or obese. In 1995, the proportion was 45 per cent.
The average waist circumference for an Australian adult male is now 97.5cm. Anything above 94cm is linked to a higher risk of developing a chronic health problem. Among women, the average waist is now 87.5cm.
One of the health problems linked to obesity is diabetes. There are now 1.2 million Australians with the condition, up from 1 million in 2011-12.
But the survey has also revealed we are changing some of our bad health habits.
Smoking rates, especially among people aged under 45, are falling sharply, with just 16 per cent of adults smoking on a daily basis. In 2001, nearly 30 per cent of adults were daily smokers.
Drinking habits are improving slightly, with 17 per cent of people drinking more than two standard drinks a day. Three years ago, it was 19.5 per cent.

MORE than 28,000 diabetes sufferers go to bed each night not knowing if they'll be alive in the morning, and the Government isn't funding a device that could save their lives.
About 28,000 type 1 diabetes patients are at risk of Dead-in-Bed syndrome when their blood-sugar levels plunge while they sleep, causing seizures, coma and death.
This is estimated to account for up to 50 type 1 diabetes deaths in Australia every year.
A continuous glucose monitor alerts patients or a parent of low blood-sugar levels, so action can be taken to prevent death or avert the hypoglycaemic event and save the hospital system money.
Without the device, parents of children with type 1 diabetes get up every two hours each night to finger-prick their child and test blood-sugar levels.
Queensland's Rebecca Line said the glucose monitor her daughter Chelsea trialled during a cheerleading championship ""saved her life two-three times in a few days"" when her blood-sugar levels crashed during the competition.
Chelsea's team won the nationals and are off to Hawaii to compete in June but Chelsea can't trial the device a second time and the $6500-plus annual cost is prohibitive.
The device costs $1200, a further $810 is needed for a receiver and the sensors, which need to be replaced each week, cost $4810 a year.
Because the monitor is not a medicine and sensors are not medical devices there is no pathway for diabetes patients to seek a government subsidy.
Subsidising the device for about 4000 high-risk children and adolescents a year would cost $10.4 million and diabetes families are asking the Government to find the money in the May Budget.
About 20 per cent of people with type 1 diabetes experience at least one severe hypoglycaemic event every six months.
About 140,000 people have type 1 diabetes. It is estimated that more than 50 children who died from complications from type 1 diabetes could have been saved by the device during the last two years.

BABIES
BABY OF THE WEEK Sage Evie Lila Woodlee Born January 24, 2015 Weight 3.18kg Hospital Tweed Heads ASIDE from being her big brothers' greatest fan, welcome baby sister Sage Woodlee is among 1400 infants involved in research aimed at finding a cure for Type 1, or juvenile, diabetes.
Mother Georgie joined the environmental determinants of islet autoimmunity, or ENDIA, study during her pregnancy with Sage, whose brother Reif, now six, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age three.
Eldest son Harry, nine, does not have the condition.
""We kept Sage's stem cells when she was born,"" Georgie says. ""She has regular blood tests to check for antibodies that indicate diabetes. If that happens, she will start getting stem cell treatment to try to stop the condition from progressing."" With Type 1 diabetes twice as common as it was 20 years ago, Georgie is hoping the research also helps to find a cure.
This would eliminate the need for Reif to take finger-prick blood tests up to 15 times a day, and injecting himself four times a day.
Georgie and dad Dave enjoy the addition of a feminine influence on their rowdy sons. ""The boys love her. And she just screams with delight when she sees the boys after school.""",D16NN004

ELECTION 2016 MENTAL HEALTH BENEFIT FOR SUFFERERS
Teenager Meg Foord, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was in Year 7, said CGM devices could help newly diagnosed children transition more smoothly into their new lives.
Meg currently uses a finger prick-style of monitor to measure her blood sugar levels.
""Obviously they'd still have their diabetes, but it would just make the whole handling of it a lot easier for someone on their mental health,"" Miss Foord, 17, said. ""It would give them that safety net that they know where they are because sometimes when you're younger you don't really know if you're low or high - you don't understand the signals yet - so they'd be able to look at this thing and see where it (their blood sugar level) is heading. Now that I've had it (Type 1) for a couple of years, I'm fine but when I first got it I found it was hard to deal with mentally. If I had something like the CGM it might have made it a bit easier."" Meg's father Chris Foord, of Highbury, said CGMs should be ""available for everyone who has Type 1 and wants to improve their way of life"". ""They'll be able to control their Type 1 a lot better themselves,"" he said.

Insulin mystery solved
A MELBOURNE medical discovery could help scientists develop better insulin to treat people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Researchers from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research say they have solved the mystery as to how insulin, a hormone in the blood, binds to the surface of cells.
It is hoped this will assist scientists develop improved insulin medications.
Institute Associate Professor Mike Lawrence said that for the first time they understood how insulin binds to insulin receptors, which help cells take up insulin from the blood for energy.
They found that the insulin and receptors perform a molecular handshake - insulin folds out and the receptor moves to engage with the insulin.
""This discovery could conceivably lead to new types of insulin that could be given in ways other than injection, or an insulin that has improved properties or longer activity so that it doesn't need to be taken as often,"" Prof Lawrence said.
""It may also have ramifications for diabetes treatment in developing nations, by creating insulin that is more stable and less likely to degrade when not kept cold.""
The research, in conjunction with Australian Synchrotron and international collaborators, was published in journal Nature.
Almost one million Australians are diagnosed with diabetes at some stage in their life, according to the latest Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report.

Pre-meal shakes could be 'game-changer' for diabetics 
A pre-meal drink for diabetes sufferers, developed by a small Australian start-up, has been proven to be the first non-pharmaceutical product to reduce blood sugar spikes.
The drink, GlucoControl, could be a game-changer, according to Chris Rayner, an Associate Professor at the University of Adelaide, which conducted a study of the product.
""Diabetes is almost at epidemic proportions in many countries, including China and the US, so there is significant global scope for a product like this to contribute to practical and effective management of type 2 diabetes across communities all over the world,"" he said. The new research by the University of Adelaide, presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting in Germany, concluded that for the first time a non-pharmaceutical, natural food-based product could significantly reduce spikes in blood sugar levels after a high Glycaemic Index meal.
Dr Rayner, a gastroenterologist, said the study revealed that GlucoControl represented a novel nutritional approach that could have a significant impact on both the immediate blood glucose spike associated with high GI meals, as well as have an impact on longer term measures of blood glucose control.
""Nutritional approaches offer a favourable way to manage type 2 diabetes that is practical for the large numbers of people - at least 1.2 million Australians are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - trying to go about their normal lives,"" he said.
""People have tried addressing this issue previously, but it is the unique blend of proteins and fibre, along with the dosage and taste, that make this a practical and functional way to address this problem. The recent data shows how comfortable people were using the product continuously for 12 weeks, showing how viable it is as a simple addition to diabetes' sufferers' lives."" Dr Rayner added that as the product was available without a prescription and was safe to use with medication, it also meant there was now more options for medical professionals, nutritionists and dietitians in helping people with type 2 diabetes have a better quality of life.
Diabetes Australia says that more than 4400 diabetes-related amputations are performed at Australian hospitals every year - around 12 amputations every day. Experts estimate that spending on diabetes-related amputations, and other costs related to diabetic foot disease, costs Australia about $875 million each year.
The pre-meal shake, developed by Omni Innovation, took six years and more than $5m in research and development to produce. It was designed for people with pre-diabetes or with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.
""While people can live a long life with type 2 diabetes, proper management is critical to avoiding its terrible outcomes,"" Arie Nudel, managing director of Omni Innovation, said. ""No intervention is any good if people don't stick with it so we were glad to see the results confirmed that participants had no trouble incorporating it into their lifestyles for the full 12 weeks."" Preventive health expert Ross Walker said anything natural that helps blunt the progression of diabetes was a good thing.

The diabetes time bomb
Poor diets fuel the fire COVER STORY
Australia will soon have a new No.1 killer, and we can't ignore it, writes Thea O'Connor.
Going blind. Getting your leg cut off. Kidneys packing up. Dying of a heart attack. The implications of being diagnosed with diabetes are shocking. Yet it seems many of us keep ignoring the alarm bells, with rates of diabetes soaring across the globe.
This disease is big. It's growing. It's scary and it's very expensive. In the next five years, diabetes will become the No.1 one cause of death and illness in Australia, which now has 1.5 million people living with the disease, according to Diabetes Australia. By 2025, it's estimated 3 million people will be affected. More than 85 per cent of all diabetes cases are type-2, which costs an estimated $14.6 billion each year, leading to the same serious types of complications as type-1 diabetes. And studies now show young people with the more preventable type-2 diabetes are twice as likely to die from the disease as those with type-1.
It's a public health timebomb.
Put simply, diabetes is a chronic condition in which a person has high blood sugar.
""The reason we have an epidemic of type-2 diabetes in Australia is because we have all the contributing factors,"" says Professor Greg Johnson, chief executive of Diabetes Australia. ""Sedentary lifestyles, easy access to processed food, weight gain and a multicultural society which includes people from high-risk genetic backgrounds, such as indigenous, Chinese, Indian and the Pacific islands.
""There's no doubt weight gain is a big driver, but it doesn't explain it all,"" Johnson says. ""There are thousands of people with type-2 diabetes who are a healthy weight and have a pretty healthy lifestyle.""
As well as those with existing diabetes, another 2 million Australians have ""pre-diabetes"", showing abnormal blood glucose levels. About 35 per cent to 40 per cent of this high-risk group will go on to develop type-2 diabetes in the next five to 10 years, says Professor Jonathan Shaw, associate director of Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute.
Coming up through the age ranks is a stream of young people being diagnosed with the ""silent killer"". Once called age-related onset diabetes because it was typically diagnosed in people after age 40, type-2 diabetes is now being diagnosed in younger adults, teens and occasionally children, Johnson says.
The Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital diabetes clinic typically treats about 50 to 60 adolescents with type-2 diabetes at any one time. ""That's been fairly constant over the last 10 years,"" says paediatric endocrinologist Dr Matt Sabin. ""The youngest person I've treated was about 12."" Young people find it harder to control diabetes, Sabin says, which helps explain why they get more complications younger, such as relying on a dialysis machine to support their failing kidneys.
HSC student Taylor Eddy, 18, from the Central Coast, was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes last year, after experiencing excessive thirst, headaches, sudden bouts of hunger and dizziness. ""When I was diagnosed I felt pretty down and daunted because I knew it was going to impact the rest of my life,"" Eddy says. ""I was kind of expecting it though, because my mum and grandmother have it, too. We are indigenous so more likely to get it, but I didn't expect it this young.
""I've found it hard to increase my exercise because of the time pressures of HSC, but a lot of sugar has come out of my diet, especially chocolates and lollies, and I eat less now overall and have lost some weight. It's really hard though when all my friends are eating chocolate, but they are very strict on me. So is my nan who I live with. They are my biggest support.""
Those at the forefront of tackling diabetes are frustrated by Australia's lack of a national approach, since type-2 diabetes is preventable. ""In research settings, healthy lifestyle programs for people at high risk of diabetes, reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by about 60 per cent,"" Shaw says. ""Real world community interventions, with fewer program resources and where participants may not be as motivated, reduce the risk by 30 per cent.
""The problem is we can't get enough people into these programs to make a real difference,"" Shaw says. ""And when we focus on prevention in the general population, not just the high-risk groups, it's really hard to make a dent because that group is so large, and because eating and activity habits are so hard to change.""
In affluent countries, underexertion and overconsumption become the norm. ""That's why we also need population measures,"" Shaw says. Finding ways to engineer more activity in our lives is one measure Shaw supports. So is taxing unhealthy foods or subsidising healthy foods. ""It's hard to get it right though,"" Shaw says, pointing to other countries' failed attempts. ""When Denmark attempted taxing high-energy foods, the Danes went to Germany to buy their treats instead... In the end though, this will be one of the important strategies that'll actually make a difference.""
A hard-hitting approach is vital, says Mike Daube, a professor of health policy at Curtin University, who has spent decades tackling the public health problems of smoking and excessive drinking. ""We've learnt from our experience with the tobacco industry that a bit of goodwill won't do the trick. Expecting the food industry to do the right thing [by not advertising unhealthy foods to children for example], without regulation is pie in the sky,"" Daube says. ""Soft, happy education doesn't work either,"" he adds, pointing to Western Australia's LiveLighter media campaign as an example of what is needed.
Recent campaign ads aim to scare people off sugary drinks by showing graphic footage of gurgling ""toxic"" fat surrounding internal organs. ""Drinking sugary drinks is contributing to our expanding waistlines leading to higher rates of heart disease, type-2 diabetes and several cancers,"" LiveLighter campaign director Maria Szybiak says. Australia's consumption of sugary drinks per head of population ranks in the top 10 in the world, with Australians guzzling 1.28 billion litres in 2012.
The main role food plays in causing diabetes is simply through providing too much energy, says Shaw. ""But there's reasonable evidence that sugar sweetened beverages have an effect above and beyond providing surplus calories.""
Kate Di Prima is a paediatric and family accredited dietitian who sees children from about the age of 12 showing early signs of type-2 diabetes. ""They are invariably over a healthy weight, eat too much overall and too much carbohydrate [such as from bread, rice, pasta] at one time. 'Discretionary foods' such as cakes, biscuits, pies, juices, cordials and soft drinks can make up 20 per cent to 50 per cent of their total energy intake.""
So what's it going to take to stem the tide? ""You can't expect prevention to work without a nationally co-ordinated plan,"" Johnson says. Diabetes Australia has released its National Diabetes Strategy and Action Plan, focusing on early detection, management and prevention.
But Daube says the community has to fuel any real change. ""We need the type of community concern and outrage that we had to fuel change with tobacco and alcohol. We're just not seeing that yet.""
Different shades
Type-1 An autoimmune disease causing destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Most cases develop in childhood or early adulthood. Treatment involves insulin injections or pump. Accounts for 10 per cent of all people with diabetes.
Type-2 Characterised by the body producing less insulin, or being resistant to insulin or both. Has a strong genetic component that's unmasked through lifestyle factors. Treatment involves a healthy lifestyle and possibly medication. Accounts for more than 85 per cent of all people with diabetes.
Gestational When diabetes first occurs during pregnancy. Occurs in 5 per cent to 10 per cent of pregnancies in Australia. Typically disappears when baby is born but mother and baby are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the next 10 to 15 years.

DIRE WARNING ON DIABETES
'We will have to build factories to cut off people's toes' - EXCLUSIVE
The rising tsunami of diabetes in Sydney's western suburbs will overwhelm hospitals within 15 years, and specialist factories will need to be built to perform amputations.
This is the warning of Western Sydney Local Health District head Danny O'Connor, who said the bloating of the local population over the past 20 years has created a disaster in waiting.
About 300,000 of the 1 million people living in western Sydney are conservatively estimated to have diabetes or be at high risk, with more than half the population of Auburn, Blacktown, Holroyd, Parramatta and the Hills District overweight. ""It's about the survival of the species,"" Mr O'Connor said.
""If we continue to consume too many calories and convert to diabetes, we will have to build factories to cut off people's toes, feet and limbs and help them when they go blind. Let's have a conversation about taxing sugary drinks.""
Diabetes costs Australia at least $14.6 billion a year, a figure expected to blow out to $30 billion by 2025, and in western Sydney people are 1? times more likely to develop it than those in other parts of Sydney.
The local health authority has formed a partnership with food chains, retailers, developers, councils and primary care groups with a goal to effect an average weight loss of four kilograms per person, bringing waistlines back to 1995 levels.

Diabetes no bar to achievement
Mollie Jones - 1934-2017
Mollie Jones was an amputee lobbyist, diabetes educator, musician and writer. Weeks before her death, she was presented with her second Kellion Victory medal by Diabetes Australia, for living with Type 1 diabetes for more than 70 years.
Mary Philomena Pegum was born in Sydney in 1934, and was nine when she was diagnosed with diabetes. It was during World War II, there was food and petrol rationing and little was known about juvenile diabetes. There were no simple pin pricks, sugar levels were gauged from urine samples heated over a Bunsen burner and the results were not reliable. Mollie had to return all of her sugar ration, but the family was delighted when it was swapped for bacon.
In 1944, Mollie spent time in Camperdown Children's Hospital stabilising her diabetes. Her mother had occasional mental health issues and doctors realised that Mollie could not rely on her parents, so she was taught how to do her own urine tests, plan her diet and, after months of cycling to the hospital, how to inject herself. The whole family went on Mollie's carefully measured diet, but the urine tests often showed erratic sugar levels and she was accused of breaking the rules. She learned to use her own intelligence and knowledge of her body to do what was best for her, often in the face of current methods. However, life at home had become stressful, with beatings from her mother. This, Mollie realised, spiked her sugar levels through stress, so, at 16, she left home.
At the time, juvenile onset diabetics were excluded from permanent positions in the public service and could not get insurance. Determined to find a career that offered financial independence, Jones discovered that male and female X-ray technicians received the same salary, so she completed three years training as a radiographer and worked in cancer therapy.
However, her real passion was music. She had studied music at the Brigidine Convent School, Randwick, then the Australian Music Examinations Board and later the NSW Conservatorium of Music. In 1953 she completed a teaching diploma (ATCL) in pianoforte through Trinity College, London.
Mollie met her future husband, IBM engineer Donald Jones, through a shared interest in theatre. The newlyweds consulted a specialist about the risk of children inheriting diabetes. They were told not to worry, as diabetes probably meant Mollie was infertile. In 1958, she gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, the first in NSW to survive to a juvenile onset diabetic. The strain of a second pregnancy, a boy, against medical advice, two years later cost her health dearly.
In the '60s and '70s the couple managed a business formed with Donald designing and building geophysical detection equipment for mining, and Mollie's speciality, technical services for audio-visual production. When the marriage ended she juggled three jobs and a mortgage to keep her family together.
From 1972 to 1975 she co-ordinated the World Education Fellowship annual residential summer arts school, which went for 10 days, organising more than a dozen courses for 300 students and staying within budget.
It took a bad relationship after her divorce and money worries to break her endless self-control and smoking and rich food led to a heart attack. She resumed physical activity much earlier than recommended, but that was the best way to balance her blood sugars.
As she was about to turn 50 she was asked to resign from her job - the board did not feel it was suitable position for a diabetic. So she cashed in her funeral fund and left for Europe with a return air ticket, and twice the amount of medication and syringes she needed. Wearing two watches, one Sydney time and the other local, she worked out the perfect balance of meals for her long days on foot. In Italy she discovered the joy of food and when she returned to Sydney, she began to cook for pleasure as well as health, and like everything she tackled, she did it very well.
At 57, Jones decided to go back to studies, receiving a BA in 1992. She began full-time honours studies in 1993 but osteomyelitis required the amputation of her right leg below the knee, and a court case resulted in the loss of her home. The only study concession she made was to switch to part-time, receiving honours in Australian literature from the University of Western Sydney, Nepean, in 1996.
The struggle to get a prosthesis that was comfortable made Jones aware of mobility issues facing amputees. She served on many advisory panels to improve prostheses and outcomes for amputees, ran a peer support group called Amputees Association in Sydney, published the quarterly Amputee Journal, and arranged fun days with events such as leg tossing.
Jones was tiny in stature and rarely without a smile, but she was indomitable. She learnt to drive a hand-operated Honda and would throw in her waterproof leg, add an insulin pack and be ready for any unexpected stay. When she had to resort to her wheelchair, she removed the footrest so she could garden. Jones was always hoping for more time to get back to her hobbies, but found it hard to refuse requests for help. Even the arthritis that robbed her of the ability to play could not stop her teaching music.
Mollie Jones is survived by children Chris, Jenny and Alister, and five grandchildren.

Meat adds to the risk of diabetes
MEAT-LOVERS could be at higher risk of diabetes - even if they eat fruit and vegetables.
A long-term study of more than 60,000 women has linked meat, cheese and other ingredients of an ""acidic diet"" with type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes.
The women who ate the most acid-forming foods were 56 per cent more likely to develop the condition than those who ate the least.
Fruit and vegetables didn't compensate for the effect.
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is usually linked to obesity and sugary foods. The latest study, however, points the finger at meat and other foods that produce acid after being digested.
It is thought the acid raises odds of diabetes by making it harder for the body to turn the sugar from the food we eat into energy.
The French study involved 66,485 women who had their health tracked for 14 years.
The volunteers had given detailed information about their diet, which was used to work out how acidic their food was after it was digested. About 1372 women had developed diabetes by the end of the study and diagnoses were particularly common in those with acidic diets.

Hope's in sight
A NEW use for an old cholesterol drug could prevent blindness in patients with Type 2 diabetes, which has affected 10,000 Australians in the past decade.
The nation's medicines regulator has approved the first tablet to help slow down diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness.
The blood fat-lowering pill Lipidil has been used for almost 10 years in Australia to manage blood cholesterol, but breakthrough Australian research has found it also helps slow down vision loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
Sydney University cardiologist Professor Tony Keech studied the effects of Lipidil on reducing heart disease in 10,000 patients with Type 2 diabetes between 1997 and 2005.
The research also tested evidence the medicine had an effect on the retina. ""We discovered that Lipidil had a major beneficial effect on eye disease and disability,"" Prof Keech said.
The need for laser surgery to prevent bleeding at the back of the eye was reduced by 37 per cent in patients using Lipidil, he said. A later US study backed this finding.
In the past decade, 20,000 Australians had limbs amputated as a result of diabetes, and the Australian study found a 36 per cent reduction in the need for this treatment in patients using Lipidil.
However, the medicine has not been approved for this use.
One million Australians have type 2 diabetes and about 300,000 of them have diabetic retinopathy that makes it difficult to read, watch TV or drive.
Studies show 60 per cent of people with Type 2 diabetes will develop eye disease within 20 years of their diagnosis.

Platypus, echidna venom could inspire diabetes medications
Venom from two iconic Australian species could be behind the development of new treatments for diabetes, which affects around 1.7 million Australians.
A team of scientists has found that platypus and echidna venom contains a long-lasting version of the hormone GLP-1, which is responsible for releasing insulin to lower blood glucose levels.
The same hormone is produced and released in the human gut, however it is not so stable and degrades within minutes.
Adelaide University evolutionary biologist Frank Grutzner said the longer lifespan of the hormone found in the animal venom raised the potential to develop drugs that extend the release of insulin in type 2 diabetes patients.
""This will prove useful for biomedical research, as there is a lot of potential there,"" he said. ""The hormone is central to metabolic control.""
Like humans and other vertebrates the platypus and echidna also produce the GLP-1 hormone, known as glucagon-like peptide-1, in their gut to control blood sugar levels.
In people with type 2 diabetes, the short stimulus triggered by the hormone is insufficient to maintain proper blood sugar levels. To manage this, medication that includes a longer-lasting form of the hormone is taken to extend the body's release of insulin.
Because the hormone found in the animal's venom doesn't degrade as rapidly, researchers are hopeful that this hormone will lead to the development of new drugs to manage diabetes in humans.
According to Diabetes Australia about 280 Australians develop diabetes every day - or one person every five minutes. Researchers, including medical biochemist Briony Forbes from Flinders University, admitted they were surprised to find that the hormone was not only active in the gut but in monotreme venom as well.
The fact that the hormone had evolved in monotremes as something that could both regulate blood glucose and fend off rival males depending on where in the body it was released also stunned researchers.
""That wasn't something that we expected,"" Professor Grutzner said.
Echidnas have a venom gland and produce venom however they do not have a spur and the venom's purpose is a bit of a mystery. Male platypuses fight for mating rights during the breeding season and can spike a rival with a poisoned spur found on the heel of their back legs. The venom enters the bloodstream - however the poisoned animal has the ability to degrade it.
""It's remarkable that they can firstly produce a more stable hormone and then secondly that they have the ability to degrade it,"" Professor Grutzner said. ""If you put the hormone into blood from a human or a mouse it wouldn't degrade.""
The findings have been published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports.

Diabetes risk with baby solids
INTRODUCING solids to a baby's diet too soon or too late could increase their risk of developing type 1 diabetes, research shows.
The US researchers said incidence of the disease was increasing around the world, and most rapidly among children aged under five.
In their study of 1835 children with an increased genetic risk of the disease, 53 went on to develop type 1 diabetes.
""The increased risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus found with early (less than four months) and late (equal or greater than six months) introduction of solid foods appears to be driven by late first exposure to rice/oat and early first exposure to wheat/barley and fruit,"" the study says.
Australian feeding guidelines recommend infants be exclusively breastfed until six months of age, when solid foods are introduced. They recommend breastfeeding continue to 12 months of age and beyond, for as long as the mother and child desire.

Drug at the heart of war on diabetes 
DIABETES will no longer be a death sentence for many sufferers, with a drug often prescribed to lower sugar levels found to significantly reduce heart problems - the biggest killer of diabetics.
Australian doctors have been given the green light to prescribe the drug Jardiance to type-2 diabetics with cardiovascular issues - a move hailed as a significant advance in the battle against the growing scourge of diabetes.
About 80 per cent of sufferers die from cardiovascular complications. Many existing diabetes medications lower blood sugar levels, which can prevent complications such as blindness and kidney damage, but do nothing for heart health.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has now listed Jardiance for use to reduce cardiovascular deaths in diabetics - the first drug to ever offer that benefit.
Sydney cardiologist Professor Andrew Sindone hailed the drug's approval as a ""big advance"" and said a third of his patients have diabetes.
""It's a big epidemic and this change will have a big impact on those people's health,"" Prof Sindone said.
Discovery of the drug's heart health benefits was made while it was being safety tested, with researchers finding it reduced the risk of a diabetic dying from cardiovascular disease by 38 per cent and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisation by 35 per cent.
""We've never had anything like that before, so this is pretty exciting,"" Prof Sindone said.
""I think this is going to revolutionise the management of people with diabetes."" He said patients on the drug passed about 18 sugar cubes worth of glucose through their urine every day and dropped about 5kg in three months.
After rigorous scrutiny of the study, published in 2015, Australian authorities have now approved the drug for use in cardiac health. ""This is our big chance to help people with diabetes,"" Prof Sindone said.

Diabetes poses a growing challenge
Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic condition in Australia and the three types of diabetes - type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes - are all increasing.
The most common, type 2, is the fastest increasing, associated with modifiable lifestyle risk factors (especially obesity) and strong genetic and family-related risk factors. Often, people with type 2 diabetes show no symptoms, and without regular health checks it does more damage.
This is a condition that can lead to more serious problems such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks and stroke. In 2011, according to statistics released this year, it was estimated that about 730,000 Australians had diagnosed diabetes.
Of those, 1.7 per cent (12,300) had lower limbs amputated as a result. With more than 280 people developing diabetes every day, you should be paying close attention to your health and have a regular GP, especially if you are already at risk.
Researchers led by Anna Hatton from the University of Queensland want to help diabetics who have foot nerve damage improve their balance and physical activity.
Hatton, from the school of health and rehabilitation sciences, says the international research effort will look at the use of shoe insoles to provide practical assistance to those in need. ""Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a consequence of diabetes, can increase the risk of falls and serious injuries requiring hospitalisation,"" she says.
""The quality of signals transmitted from the feet to the brain, when damaged, disrupts the vital cues required to help people remain upright.
""Using shoe insoles to correct balance and walking problems in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy could lead to meaningful change to people's independence in their daily lives."" The study, supported by funding from Diabetes Australia, is based at UQ's St Lucia campus and requires interested and suitable participants to wear a pair of shoe insoles for four weeks and a small activity monitor on the leg for two separate weeks.
Blood glucose levels are not only an important indicator of diabetes but also brain atrophy in ageing. Erin Walsh from the Centre for Research on Ageing, Health and Wellbeing at the Australian National University says people without diabetes can still have high enough blood glucose levels to have a negative health impact.
""The research suggests that maintaining healthy blood glucose levels can help promote healthy brain ageing,"" Walsh says.
""If you don't have diabetes, it's not too early and if you do have diabetes it's not too late."" Walsh suggests people adopt healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise and a good diet. ""Having a healthy lifestyle contributes to good glycaemic control without needing a diabetes diagnosis to spur them into adopting these good habits,"" she says.
""It helps to keep unhealthy highly processed and sugary foods to a minimum. Also, regular physical activity every day can help, even if it is just a going for walk.""
Australia's first university department dedicated to diabetes has been opened by federal Health Minister Greg Hunt. Monash University's department of diabetes is the first of its kind, a partnership between the Central Clinical School in its faculty of medicine, nursing and health sciences, and Alfred Health.
""Diabetes is a debilitating disease and serious health issue affecting more than one million Australians,"" Hunt says. ""The department of diabetes will bring together some of the brightest researchers in the world to find new treatments and cures.
""Medical research is a key pillar of the government's long-term national health plan and can provide real outcomes which benefit Australian patients.
""We're also backing this research with more than $764 million for diabetes-related research allocated since 2000."" Professor of medicine and principal adviser of the department of diabetes, Paul Zimmet, says all those involved had an opportunity to tackle ""one of the largest epidemics in human history"".
Research into diabetes may also improve the understanding and treatment of other conditions.
Researchers from the University of Birmingham in Britain have found a drug commonly used to treat patients with either obesity or type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 agonist drugs, could also help lower brain pressure. Their findings will be published in the journal Science Translational Medicine and presented this week at the International Headache Society meeting in Canada.
""Treatments to lower brain pressure are lacking and new treatments are desperately needed,"" says Alexandra Sinclair from the university's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research. ""These findings are rapidly translatable into a new novel treatment strategy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension... (and) also potentially game-changing for other conditions featuring raised brain pressure, including stroke, hydrocephalus and traumatic brain injury.""

YOUR HEALTHY WEEK STARTS HERE
CHEERS TO THIS!
DRINK YOUR WAY OUT OF DIABETES Good news: As you savour your next glass of wine, you can do so in the knowledge it could be lowering your risk of diabetes.
A Danish study found that men and women who drank alcohol three to four times during the week had a 27 per cent and 32 per cent reduced risk, respectively, compared to those who drank less than one drink per week.
But not all alcohol is created equal, according to the researchers. While seven glasses of wine per week was associated with 25-30 per cent lower risk, a similar number of beers reduced diabetes risk in men only (21 per cent lower) and had no effect on women.
And it's not such good news for lovers of spirits - seven or more of those over a week actually increased diabetes risk in women by a whopping 83 per cent.

Mums pass on 'bad' sugar in breast milk
BREASTFEEDING mothers often crave sugary treats to fight the exhaustion of new motherhood - but they may be passing that sugar on to their babies.
Researchers have found that fructose, a type of sugar linked to health issues ranging from obesity to diabetes, is passed from mother to baby through breast milk.
Researchers at California's Keck School of Medicine found preliminary evidence that even fructose equivalent to the weight of a grain of rice in a full day's serving of breast milk is associated with increased body weight, muscle and bone mineral content.
Fructose is found in fruit and is added to food and soft drinks but it is not a natural component of breast milk.
Exposing infants to higher amounts of ""second-hand"" sugar during growth and development can produce problems with cognitive development and learning, as well as create risks for obesity, diabetes and heart disease, lead researcher Michael Goran said. Healthy, naturally occurring sugars in breast milk include lactose.

Proteomics develops test to better predict onset of diabetic kidney disease
Australian life sciences company Proteomics is set to announce today a world first for a predictive test for the diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease.
A $2 million, 576-patient, clinical study completed in Western Australia between 2010-14 has found that 10 per cent of the patient population with diabetes progressed to kidney disease.
""Proteomics's predictive test predicted with a high level of accuracy the specific individuals in the 576-patient population who constituted the 10 per cent,"" the company said.
The test can predict which patients with diabetes will progress to have diabetic kidney disease and which people with normal kidney function, as measured by conventional tests, are at risk of developing the disease.
There is currently no available test for predicting the onset of diabetic kidney disease and Proteomics said its test, which had been validated, represented a breakthrough in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The company said the benefits to it successfully commercialising the test were enormous.
""The potential for major pharmaceutical companies to use a predictive diagnostic test for diabetic kidney disease to identify at-risk patient groups and then use their branded therapeutic drugs in a treatment regime has major benefits to the pharmaceutical companies and also to Proteomics, in the form of royalties, licensing fees or other revenue streams they may derive,"" Proteomics said.
The company said it was in talks with several global pharmaceutical companies about partnering and licensing opportunities to commercialise the test.
""We will now seek to accelerate these, and also expand them to include other interested parties based on the validation of predictive diabetic kidney disease diagnostic test."" The Perth-based company specialises in the area of proteomics, the study of the structure and function of proteins. It has one central technology that performs protein analysis across three areas - a service business, a diagnostics business and a drug discovery business. The diagnostic arm focuses testing products for diabetic kidney disease and Alzheimer's and operates in the biomarkers market, estimated to double in size to $40.8 billion by 2018.One in ten of the world's population is tipped to have diabetes by 2035 and according to the US Centre for Disease Control of the 592 million people with diabetes today, 35 per cent of adults have chronic kidney disease.

Food fad alarm: gluten-free diet increases risk of type 2 diabetes
Following a gluten-free diet can increase your risk of contracting type 2 diabetes, a massive new US study has found.
Research led by Harvard University indicates that people who eat more gluten have less chance of developing the disease, and vice-versa.
The findings, presented overnight at an American Heart Association forum in Oregon, suggest that a fad for supposedly healthy food may be exacerbating the global diabetes epidemic triggered by dodgy diets and sedentary lifestyles.
The researchers believe gluten-free advocates are making themselves sick by unnecessarily avoiding essential nutrients found in cereal fibre and wholegrains, which have been shown to reduce diabetes risk. Lead researcher Geng Zong said people should reconsider limiting their gluten intake unless they had a solid medical reason for doing so.
""Gluten-free foods often have less dietary fibre and other micronutrients, making them less nutritious,"" said Dr Zong, a researcher with Harvard's TH Chan School of Public Health. ""They also tend to cost more."" The study crunched data from longitudinal studies covering about 200,000 Americans and stretching over three decades - long before the gluten-free fad's emergence. It found that the one-fifth of participants who consumed the least gluten developed type 2 diabetes at a rate 13 per cent higher than the 20 per cent who ate the most.
Gluten, a protein found in grains such as wheat, rye and barley, gives bread and pastries their chewy texture. Some people cannot tolerate it, usually because they have coeliac disease - a serious disorder in which the immune system targets the protein as a foreign invader. About one in 70 Australians have this condition. At least as many again have or claim to have ""gluten sensitivity"" - a less serious condition about which some experts are sceptical. Gluten-intolerant people are vastly outnumbered by those who eschew the protein with no medical reason.
When Penelope Lowry made a commitment to healthy living 10 years ago, she bade farewell to gluten. ""I wanted to try and rebalance my gut,"" said the 47 year-old Sydney marketing manager, who also avoids processed foods. ""Through a process of elimination, I decided that saying goodbye to gluten was going to be better for me and my overall health."" Ms Lowry said the results of the US study were surprising but understandable, because many people adopted fad diets without taking the necessary precautions.
""When gluten-free diets were fashionable a few years ago, a lot of food companies tried to cash in but supplemented gluten with more sugar. People thought they were being healthy and were blindly eating something advertised as gluten-free, which was actually very high in sugar."" An Australian study last year found that gluten-free diets were leaving many athletes short of calories while producing no discernible benefits to sports performance or wellbeing.
Some 18 per cent of Australians avoid gluten, according to estimates from the Grains and Legumes Nutrition Council. Nutritionist Rosemary Stanton said the gluten-free fad had been fostered by endorsements from movie stars and other celebrities. ""It becomes a fashion,"" she said. ""If people have doubts about their diet, the best thing they could do is go and see a registered dietitian and sort out what they need to eat. Instead, they self-diagnose.""

Beauty of this idea's skin deep
A CLEVER combination of South Australian expertise in healing burns and treating diabetes promises to deliver a cure that's skin deep.
The Royal Adelaide Hospital doctors plan to use artificial skin as a home for insulin-producing islet cells lacking in people with type 1 diabetes.
The skin, made from a biodegradable polymer, is used by Professor John Greenwood of the RAH Burns Unit for burns victims and now will be tested as a delivery system for islets.
Professor Toby Coates, Director of Kidney and Pancreatic Islet Transplantation at the RAH, says the technique has enormous potential.
""Traditionally we transplant islet cells into the liver to help treat type 1 diabetes patients, however the harsh...environment of the liver means a large number of islet cells die during the process,"" he said.
""The key component of this research is to modify and optimise artificial skin to create a new site to transplant islet cells in people with type 1 diabetes."" That would mean donor cells from one pancreas could be used to treat more people.
""At the moment it takes six pancreases to cure one person,"" Prof Coates said. ""If this works we would anticipate one organ would treat four people, so 24 times more people could be treated."" The research has attracted $1.1 million in funding from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International in New York. Adelaide-based Skin Tissue Engineering director Julian Burton said his partner Prof Greenwood had the idea to use the artificial skin.
""We're just in the right spot at the right time to really do something to make South Australia a centre of excellence,"" Mr Burton said. A world-first trial in 30 pigs will begin in September.

Organ grinds out hope
MELBOURNE researchers have discovered a protein that could help prevent overweight Australians from developing type 2 diabetes.
Monash University scientists believe the protein that contributes to insulin resistance in people with fatty livers could be a potential target for drugs.
Up to one-third of Australians are affected by non-alcoholic liver disease, putting them at risk of type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart attacks.
The condition is caused by fat building up in the liver cells. and is more common in the overweight or obese.
""One of the first things that happens to many people when they become obese is that they get a fatty liver, which precedes type 2 diabetes,"" Monash University Department of Physiology Professor Matthew Watt said.
Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not make adequate insulin or becomes resistant to it. It is a precursor to diabetes.
But it was unclear precisely how insulin resistance developed and whether a fatty liver was the culprit.
Researchers at the university's School of Biomedical Sciences studied obese mice and found fatty livers secreted a different subset of proteins to normal livers.
Prof Watt said this set of proteins also caused insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
""We examined one of these proteins in great detail and found it caused insulin resistance in several tissues,"" he said.
They validated the findings by testing the blood of patients with fatty liver disease and found that they had elevated levels of the proteins.
The amount of the protein correlated with the level of insulin resistance. Prof Watt said it was not a cure for type 2 diabetes, but if it could be blocked it may improve insulin resistance.
The next step is to work out whether blocking the protein in mice could improve the insulin sensitivity (or ""reverse the insulin resistance"").
The research, which was carried out with scientists in the Netherlands, had been submitted for publication in a medical journal.
It is estimated that more than 950,000 Australians have type 2 diabetes. That figure is expected to grow to 3.3 million by 2031.

Low blood sugar raises diabetics' risk of death
SUFFERING episodes of low blood sugar puts type-2 diabetics at a significantly greater risk of heart attack, stroke and death and they remain vulnerable for months and years after the incidents.
A world-first study between QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute and the University of Leicester, in collaboration with insulin manufacturer Novo Nordisk, found hypoglycaemic episodes increase the risk of cardiovascular disease by 50-70 per cent for people with type-2 diabetes, the most common form.
The study also found that, on average, a patient suffered a ""cardiovascular event"", such as a heart attack or stroke, just 1? years after their first hypoglycaemic event.
Head of clinical trials and the biostatistics unit at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Sanjoy Paul said the research also showed hypoglycaemia, a common problem for diabetics, led to a twofold increased risk of death. The number of Australians with diabetes is expected to reach 3.5 million by 2033.

Breakthrough gives type 1 diabetes sufferers hope
Rosina Pavlovic isn't overstating things when she says her son Dane's diabetes dominates her life and that of her family.
""It's huge, it consumes our life.""
Cooking at home when the meal can be tailored is one thing. But going out for dinner invariably means counting carbs before consuming.
If it's pizza, Dane's favourite meal, the thickness of the base, size of the slices and topping ingredients are closely scrutinised.
Diagnosed when five years old, Dane's type 1 diabetes demands round-the-clock monitoring. It's not uncommon for his father Zlatan to stay up until 1am to do one last finger prick test to make sure Dane's blood sugar levels are OK and he can get through the night.
Now 10, Dane is getting to grips with managing his diabetes and is well versed in explaining why he might need to stop playing basketball mid-game or remove himself from the classroom.
""He lives a life of compromises,"" Mrs Pavlovic said of her youngest son.
""It's 'Yes you can have this but you have to do that', or 'Of course you can play that sport but you need to test before, during and after'.""
But it may not always be the case for type 1 diabetes patients, after research by American and Australian scientists established what causes the body to mistakenly attack and destroy its own insulin-producing cells.
The international team found that when two protein fragments in beta cells, the cells that secrete insulin, collided they formed a hybrid which the body's immune system mistakenly identified as a foreign object to be destroyed.
This leaves people with type 1 diabetes unable to produce insulin, the hormone that regulates the body's use of glucose.
University of Colorado research first identified the phenomenon in mice and it was confirmed in humans by scientists at St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne.
""It's a bit like a fruit salad,"" said St Vincent's immunologist Stuart Mannering. ""You have your banana, watermelon, grapes and everything else in a bowl but sometimes the banana sticks to the watermelon and becomes one,"" Dr Mannering said.
The findings, published in Science on Friday, will help researchers intervene to stop the body attacking itself - potentially meaning a new treatment. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, there were 2323 new cases of type 1 diabetes in Australia in 2013, equating to 11 cases per 100,000 people.
While Mrs Pavlovic knows improvements in the lives of Dane and other diabetics will still be some years off, she still welcomed the news.

Dietary factors are hurting the fight against obesity as our diabetes epidemic worsens by the day
Australia is in the grip of the twin crises of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and despite all efforts, it continues to worsen. A staggering 280 Australians develop diabetes every day. That's one person every five minutes with a total annual cost impact of diabetes in Australia estimated to be $14.6 billion.
There are so many dietary factions out there. Do you listen to the ""low calorie"" camp, the ""low fat"" camp, the ""high protein"" camp, the ""low carb"" camp, or the ""low GI"" camp? They all say they've got the answer for what ails you.
Efforts on the part of individuals to lose weight through caloric restriction or increased exercise are rarely successful; and if they are, the weight loss doesn't last long.
It's assumed that people who are obese are ""non-compliant"" or ""weak-willed"". Rather, they are fighting a losing battle.
Following current dietary advice is counter-intuitive to achieving a healthy weight.
The reason is the myth of energy balance. If you believe this, then you believe that obesity is a physics problem; too much energy in, too little energy out. Energy balance assumes that all calories are equal, no matter where they come from. Rather, obesity is about energy deposition into fat tissue.
Obesity is a biochemistry problem, and where those nutrients came from determine where they go in the body. It's called nutritional biochemistry and it shows that all calories are not created equal.
Rather, it's the insulin response that determines whether any given calories will deposit into fat tissue or not. Insulin has two roles in the body. The first is to store energy in fat cells, driving weight gain. The second is to block the signal of the hormone leptin in the brain.
Leptin is a hormone made in fat cells. When leptin works as it is supposed to, it tells the brain that we do not need to eat so much and then we can burn energy at a normal rate. High insulin levels can block the action of leptin in the brain and trick our body into thinking it's starving.
How do you feel when you're starved? Hungry and slothy. Obesity is brain starvation. This explains how elevated insulin levels block leptin signalling, and therefore increase food intake, decrease activity, and promote weight gain.
Put simply, insulin drives all of the behaviours seen in obesity. The biochemistry comes first.
In Australia, almost two in three people are overweight or obese and 6 per cent have diabetes; this number has tripled in just 15 years. I believe one of the main culprits is sugar in the Australian diet.
Most people think sugar is just another form of over-consumed kilojoules. Our research says otherwise. We have shown that sugar is toxic (unrelated to its calories or its effects on weight gain) and directly responsible for a host of chronic diseases.
Dietary sugar (sucrose) is composed of two molecules, glucose and fructose. While the glucose raises insulin and promotes weight gain, it's the fructose that leads to chronic diseases like diabetes. Fructose is metabolised in the liver in the same way as alcohol, so it should not be surprising that children now get the diseases of alcohol (type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease) without consuming alcohol.
Our research shows that total caloric availability is unrelated to diabetes prevalence worldwide. For every extra 150 calories per person per day available in any country, diabetes prevalence rose by only 0.1 per cent. But if those 150 calories per day happened to be a can of soda, diabetes prevalence rose 11-fold, by 1.1 per cent. In fact, we have proof-positive data that sugar causes four chronic diseases: type 2 diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, and tooth decay.
Sugar also stimulates the reward centre of the brain similar to what nicotine, heroin, or alcohol does, driving continued consumption.
Studies show that sugar is slowly killing people around the world, anywhere the Western diet has replaced indigenous diets. Sugar is ubiquitous, appearing in virtually every processed food, and so it's not easy to reduce your consumption of sugar. The World Health Organisation recommends limiting our intake of free sugars to no more than 10 per cent of total daily energy intake to reduce the risk of metabolic disease, such as diabetes.
In Australia the guidelines say just 5 per cent of the daily diet, or about six teaspoons, can come from added sugars, but Australians actually eat double that - more like 14 teaspoons.
The easiest way to dramatically cut down on sugar and fructose consumption is to switch to a diet of ""real"" i.e. whole, unprocessed foods. But this is not what the food industry is selling.
And all those dietary factions? There are two things that every successful diet out there shares. They're all ""low-sugar, high-fibre"". Because they're all REAL food. Processed food is the enemy.
Reducing sugar and processed food and turning back the obesity and diabetes epidemics won't be easy but it's up to every one of us.

Drug stops diabetes taking a deadly turn
Australian researchers are planning trials of a drug to stop diabetes turning deadly, after tests on mice found it could prevent one of the condition's most lethal complications.
Scientists from Melbourne and Sweden say they have found a way to halt the progression of diabetic kidney disease, a potentially fatal development that afflicts people with both major types of diabetes.
The findings, outlined in the journal Cell Metabolism, also suggest diabetic kidney disease may not be a complication of diabetes but a sister illness triggered by the same causes.
Co-author Andrew Nash said it had long been assumed diabetic kidney disease was caused by excess glucose in the blood but the new study suggested diabetic kidney disease was the result of a build-up of fatty acids in certain tissues, a phenomenon thought to lead to diabetes itself.
""This research addresses an important area of unmet medical need,"" said Dr Nash, an immunologist with Australian-based pharmaceutical giant CSL.
""(It) could lead to an entirely new approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes."" Diabetic kidney disease, the most common cause of kidney failure, occurs when the filters of the kidneys, known as the ""glomeruli"", become scarred and less able to purify the blood. The new drug prevents fatty acids from accumulating in the kidneys by blocking the activity of a ""receptor"" protein on cell surfaces. Dr Nash said CSL planned to begin human trials of the drug, ""2H10"", late this year.

Nation stands to lose billions from diabetes 
LOST productivity from diabetes will strip $3.4 billion from Australian Government coffers in 2030, new research has found.
It predicted diabetes will cost $350 million in welfare payments, $166 million in uncollected taxation revenue and $2.9 billion in lost gross domestic product by 2030 - up 38 per cent from 2015.
This is on top of the direct healthcare costs of diabetes which increased from $811 million in 2000-01 to $1.5 billion in 2008-08, or 86 per cent.
The first-of-its-kind study also found people aged between 45 and 65 with diabetes collectively stood to lose out on $807 million in lost wages by 2030.
The authors of the University of Queensland and University of Sydney study have called for urgent action, acknowledging the true cost of the condition was likely to be ""even larger"" than predicted because their study does not factor in all expenses related to the condition including ""informal carer costs"".
Endocrinologist Marteen Kamp, a spokesman for the Australian Medical Association, said Type II diabetes was costly for both individuals and the Government.
But weight loss of just five or seven kilograms could reduce the risk of contracting the dangerous condition by up to 60 per cent.
""If you're worried about health, you should be worried about diabetes,"" he said. ""If you're worried about wealth, either your own or the country's, you should be worried about diabetes."" The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found the number of people aged 45 to 65 forced out of the labour market by diabetes would grow from 21,400 in 2030, up from 18,100 in 2015.
National Diabetes Services Scheme data shows across the country more than 1.2 million people have diabetes - about 5 per cent of the population.
South Australia has the highest prevalence of the disease of any state or territory at 6 per cent of the state's population.
Rates have been increasing up from 4.9 per cent nationally in 2015 and 5.8 per cent in SA.
Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said the true burden of the disease was set to be ""enormous"", but it wasn't too late to turn things around. She called on hospital emergency departments to routinely screen for diabetes when testing the blood of patients to help identify those who are at risk as part of a multi-pronged prevention approach.

More than 1.5 million Australians have diabetes and it is poised to become the number one disease burden in the next five years.
The Government is examining ways to control the $600 million a year it spends on products to help combat the problem.
Already an expert government committee has found taxpayers could save $50 million a year if it stopped supplying blood glucose strips to Type 2 diabetes patients who don't use insulin.
Another review is looking at who gets access to insulin pumps and a third review is examining the use of Type 2 diabetes medicines.
The Herald Sun has obtained a letter signed by 18 medico, research, consumer and pharmaceutical groups that expresses ""serious concern"" the reviews will focus only on cost-effectiveness.
""Ultimately, if the Diabetes Review serves only to cut expenditure on diabetes treatment it will have failed to deliver on its potential to advance the clinical management of diabetes,"" it says.
At the heart of their concerns is their claim that current guidelines on diabetes treatment are not up to date.
Bizarrely, the group also complains about the Government's price disclosure process, which ensures the Government pays the market price for drugs.
This process has generated around $1.3 billion in savings that can be used to fund new medicines and cut the amount general patients pay for drugs.
""We need a new treatment algorithm,"" Diabetes Australia chief Greg Johnson said. ""We are falling behind because there are more medicines available in other countries.""
A government review has found a large proportion of the prescriptions supplied through the medicine subsidy scheme for a new class of diabetes medicines called gliptins ""do not meet the criteria for PBS subsidy"".
Three other diabetes medicines are also being given to patients outside the rules of the subsidy scheme and this could provide scope to tighten access.
""As gliptins are much more costly than sulfonylureas, use outside of the current PBS restrictions is unlikely to be cost-effective at the current prices,"" the government review found.
But Diabetes Australia says patients need individualised treatment plans that include new medicines as their diabetes progresses.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Ageing said reviews of medicines were conducted through a transparent process, which included public consultation. ""The letter referred to in the question will be considered in the review as part of the stakeholder consultation process,"" she said.

Sugar to blame in obesity upsurge
EXCESS sugar and carbohydrates, not lack of exercise, are behind the surge in obesity and diabetes in Australia, with even those of normal weight now at risk of illness, according to experts.
We should be eating more fat and protein to cut our risk of diabetes and other health problems, a group of experts including a cardiologist, sports scientist and a physician say.
Advocates of the low carb diet, who make their case in an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine today, are the same experts who appeared on a controversial ABC Catalyst program on extreme low carbohydrate diets in November last year.
Sports scientist Professor Tim Noakes and physician and author of the New Atkins diet Dr Steve Phinney accuse the carbohydrate-fuelled food industry of using tactics ""chillingly similar to those of Big Tobacco,"" which deployed denial, doubt, confusion and ""bent scientists"" to convince the public that smoking was not linked to lung cancer.
""Research indicates cutting down on dietary carbohydrate is the single most effective approach for reducing all of the features of the metabolic syndrome and should be the primary strategy for treating diabetes, with benefits occurring even in the absence of weight loss,"" researchers said.
The prevalence of diabetes increases 11-fold for every 150 additional sugar calories consumed daily, compared with the equivalent amount of calories consumed as fat, they said.
The editorial said up to 40 per cent of those with a normal weight can have their health adversely affected by the high carbohydrate diet common in modern societies.
A high sugar, high carbohydrate diet puts them at risk of hypertension, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease and heart disease even though they are not overweight, the experts claimed.
They said advice that encourages people to maintain a healthy weight through calorie counting ignores evidence that it is the source of the calories that matters: ""Sugar calories promote fat storage and hunger. Fat calories induce fullness or satiation."" Dietitian Rosemary Stanton, who helped write the NH&MRC national dietary guidelines, said a lower carbohydrate diet was good if people cut out the cakes, biscuits and sugary breakfast cereals that now make up 35 per cent of our diets. But, she said we should still eat the carbohydrates in wholegrains and fruit. Diets high in wholegrains and fruit reduce the risk of bowel cancer and diabetes and you won't get all the vitamins you need on the low carbohydrate diet, Ms Stanton said.

Dementia may be end stage of diabetes
ALZHEIMER'S may actually be the late stages of type 2 diabetes, scientists say.
They have found that the extra insulin produced by those with T2 diabetes also gets into the brain, disrupting its chemistry. Eventually it leads to the formation of toxic clumps of amyloid proteins that poison brain cells.
""The discovery could explain why people who develop T2 diabetes often show sharp declines in cognitive function, with an estimated 70 per cent developing Alzheimer's - far more than in the rest of the population,"" said Ewan McNay, a Briton whose research at Albany University in New York state was co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association.
""People who develop diabetes have to realise this is about more than controlling their weight or diet. It's also the first step on the road to cognitive decline.
""At first they won't be able to keep up with their kids playing games, but in 30 years' time they may not even recognise them.""
The higher risk of Alzheimer's disease in T2 diabetics has been known for a long time. However, since few obese people survive into old age, the effects have had less attention.
Now, however, better treatments mean a sharp improvement in the survival rates of people with T2 diabetes - meaning there is likely to be a surge in Alzheimer's cases.
Professor McNay fed rats on a high-fat diet to induce T2 diabetes and then carried out memory tests, showing that the animals' cognitive skills deteriorated rapidly as the disease progressed.
Clumps of amyloid protein had formed in their brains, the same kind found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

Crash diet hailed as cure for diabetes
TYPE 2 diabetics have been offered new hope after scientists found a short-term crash diet can reverse the disease and restore their natural insulin levels.
They found that putting overweight diabetics on a diet of just 800 calories a day cleared the disease and returned them to health in a few weeks.
So far the technique has been tested successfully on only 11 patients, but now it is to be the subject of a $4.4 million medical trial involving 280 people with obesity-induced diabetes.
The hope is that the crash diet could provide a clinical treatment for GPs to use to tackle the epidemic of diabetes.
Roy Taylor, director of the magnetic resonance imaging centre at Britain's Newcastle University, said the early findings were ""enormously exciting"".
""We demonstrated that by changing calorie intake we could change fat levels in the liver and pancreas and return insulin production to normal,"" Professor Taylor said.
""The new study is to see whether GPs can use this approach to reverse diabetes in their patients and whether it will stay reversed.
The evidence is that it will, but we need a large-scale trial to prove that it works.""
Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely correlated with obesity. It occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that moves glucose from the blood and into cells where it can be used for energy.
With insufficient insulin, blood sugar soars, with a raft of dangerous side effects.
These include a sharply increased risk of heart attack and stroke, blindness, foot amputation and dementia.
Scientists already know that people who undergo weight-loss surgery such as gastric bypasses often see their type 2 diabetes go into remission, but such treatments are dangerous and seen as the last resort.
The crash-diet approach is based on new evidence about the underlying cause of the disease, linking its onset to the depositing of fat around the liver and pancreas.
In healthy people the liver should contain only about 2 per cent fat, but in the obese this can exceed 40 per cent, which, research shows, can suppress insulin production.
Professor Taylor and his co-researcher Mike Lean, professor of human nutrition at Glasgow University, who will be jointly overseeing the new trial, used MRI scans to observe how crash dieting rapidly removes these particular fat deposits, potentially explaining why it gets such rapid results.
""The good news is that if you cut fat in the diet then the liver fat falls very rapidly - and that means the pancreas can start working again,"" said Professor Taylor.

Diabetics' limb loss rate falls
QUEENSLAND has reported a dramatic drop in the number of amputations in patients with diabetes despite increases nationally.
Podiatrist Peter Lazzarini said diabetes-related lower limb amputations in Queensland had plummeted from about 770 to 670 in the five years to 2009-10 after new systems were put in place to manage patients.
Rates of amputations per 100,000 people in Queensland as a result of diabetes have decreased by 20 per cent and continue to fall, he said.
Mr Lazzarini, a senior research fellow at the Queensland University of Technology, said the reduction in amputations and a corresponding cut in diabetes-related hospital admissions had saved the taxpayer about $10 million a year.
He was due to present his findings to the Australian Diabetes Society's scientific meeting in Sydney yesterday.
Australia was second only to the US in having the worst rates of diabetes-related amputations in the developed world at 18 per 100,000 people, he said. Queensland rates have been slashed to 15 per 100,000.
Mr Lazzarini, who also works as a part-time podiatrist, said the reduction in Queensland had coincided with the introduction of specialist multi-disciplinary diabetic foot care teams in more than 50 hospitals and community health sites throughout the state.
He said a pilot program at the Mount Isa and Princess Alexandra hospitals in 2008 proved so effective in lowering the rate of amputations it was rolled out across the state. Most lower limb amputations are carried out on people who have had poorly controlled diabetes for more than a decade.

CHOCOHOLICS can rejoice. It seems some parts of chocolate can help fight diabetes.
A study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry found the presence of these compounds promoted the production of insulin ? the hormone that manages glucose or blood sugar.
The full benefits could be gained from dark chocolate, or chocolate with a high cocoa content.
Chocolate lover Jaimee-Lee Thompson was excited by the study. ""I'm really happy. Now I can eat more. (Dark chocolate) is an acquired taste, but I like the bitterness,"" she said.

Major diabetes study
THE Aboriginal community has one of the world's highest rates of type 2 diabetes, up to four times the rate of other Australians.
This is a major focus of SAHMRI researchers, who are looking for causes, how to deal with the disease and its complications, and how to prevent it in the first place.
The work will benefit millions of other people in the process as the disease affects around 400 million people worldwide.
SAHMRI's Aboriginal Diabetes Study is now recruiting 4000 Aborigines across South Australia to take part, 2000 with the disease and 2000 who do not have it.
Professor Paul Zimmet, co-chair of the Federal Government's National Diabetes Strategy Advisory Group, praised the SAHMRI project and noted the cause of the condition were more complex than commonly thought.
He said there seemed to be a view in the community that it was just due to being overweight and not exercising, but that some people may be genetically programmed to be prone to the disease even before they were born.
""The health of the mother and baby appear to play a bigger role than previously thought,"" he said.
""We are just now understanding that the mother's behaviour while the baby is still in the womb can cause genetic changes.
""Data suggests these changes can determine the future risks of things like diabetes, obesity and heart disease.
""Things like poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol, exposure to toxins can create these genetic changes.
""This landmark study will help us understand these drivers so we can act on them.
Aboriginal Health Theme Leader, Professor Alex Brown said it was hoped to recruit one in six Aboriginal people over the age of 15 in SA to help with the study.
""Each person will be asked to give us a short amount of their time to provide us with vital information on the factors associated with diabetes and the risks of developing diabetes,"" he said.
""We are especially interested in looking at the complications of diabetes, such as kidney, eye, feet and heart problems. We will carry out preliminary genomic investigations to seek novel causes and differences that may explain the development of complications."" He said that to make a real difference for Aboriginal communities, the study needed the assistance of Aboriginal people, communities and organisations across SA.

Mums need check-ups after gestational diabetes
GESTATIONAL diabetes mellitus (GDM) - defined as higher than normal blood glucose levels during pregnancy in women who do not have type 1 or type 2 diabetes - affects at least 20,000 Australian women a year.
Diagnosed in 5 to 9 per cent of all pregnancies, GDM occurs when maternal hormones produced by the placenta to support the baby's growth and development, hinder the action of the mother's insulin.
Insulin, produced by the pancreas, is responsible for regulating the amount of glucose in blood.
During pregnancy, women require two to three times the usual amount of insulin to overcome the interference by maternal hormones.
If the pancreas is unable to withstand the extra demand for insulin production, blood glucose levels rise and GDM develops.
While there are a number of risk factors associated with developing gestational diabetes, including being over 30 years of age, being overweight, having a family history of type 2 diabetes and being from a particular ethnic background (including Asian, Middle Eastern, Polynesian, Mediterranean, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander), many women who develop GDM do not have any identifiable risk factors.
The aim of GDM treatment is to manage blood glucose levels with a combination of healthy eating, physical activity and regular blood glucose monitoring. Diabetes medication may also be used. Consequences of high blood glucose levels during pregnancy include giving birth to a large baby, increased risk of difficult labour and greater likelihood of induction and caesarean section.
The majority of women with GDM have a healthy pregnancy, a normal delivery and a healthy baby, and usually the mother's blood glucose levels return to normal after birth.
However, they have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future, with reports suggesting a 35 to 60 per cent chance of this within 10 to 20 years of giving birth. Women with a history of GDM are encouraged to be screened annually for type 2 diabetes.

Babies could help to cure diabetes 
NEWBORN babies could help scientists pinpoint the triggers of type 1 diabetes. The biggest study of its kind in the southern hemisphere will investigate why prevalence of the auto-immune disease has doubled in the past two decades.
It is believed that children are exposed to triggers in the environment for the disease as babies, or while they are still in the womb.
Royal Melbourne researchers are part of the national team investigating whether exposures during pregnancy - the mother's nutrition, diet or microbes - could explain why some babies develop the disease and others do not.
The 1600 babies, who have relatives with the auto-immune disease, will be examined over three years in a bid to find ways to prevent the disease. In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the pancreas cells that produce insulin, which regulates the conversion of sugars in food into energy.
The research will focus on islet autoimmunity: an underlying autoimmunity to insulin-producing cells, that can be detected in the blood stream before symptoms diabetes start.
The national research team want to determine the environmental factors that trigger it. Pregnant women from South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and NSW with a first degree relative with the auto-immune disease are being recruited for the trial.
Newborn babies less than six months old are also eligible.
Victorian woman Kim Bush has enrolled her baby, Zachary, 10 months, in the trial.
The type 1 diabetic suffered numerous diabetes-related complications during her pregnancies and lost three babies.
She is desperate to help researchers because she knows how taxing diabetes can be.
""The research is critical because it could lead to prevention or a cure,"" Mrs Bush said.
Royal Melbourne Hospital Diabetes and Endocrinology Director Professor Peter Colman said he believed that environmental exposures during pregnancy through to early childhood could be the key to understanding the development of the disease.
He said more than 122,000 Australians suffer from type 1 diabetes, but the incidence increases 3.2 per cent a year. To take part in the study: www.endia.org.au or (03) 9342 8641.VIDEO: HOW POLLUTION MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DIABETES IN KIDS. GO TO ADVERTISER.COM.AU

Surgery may help stem the tide of diabetes 
ADVERTISING FEATURE - Weight-loss surgery
Many factors are at play when it comes to the excess weight Australians are gaining.
Diabetes types 1 and 2 has created a ""medical tsunami"" for Australia, with about 1.5 million people suffering from the devastating disease, says bariatric and upper gastrointestinal surgeon Dr Ken Loi.
An executive member of the Obesity Surgery Society of Australia and New Zealand (OSSANZ) for seven years, Dr Loi says the organisation recently voted to change its name to MOSSANZ, adding 'Metabolic' to its name in recognition of the effectiveness of treatment for diabetes and other metabolic conditions such as sleep apnoea, hypertension and high cholesterol.
Dr Loi has undertaken an extensive review of Medicare for the federal government, setting up item numbers for all types of bariatric surgery including sleeve gastrectomy, and was one of the first Australian surgeons to perform that procedure in Sydney.
He says the health consequences of obesity are far-reaching. ""People who are obese or morbidly obese are up to 50 per cent more likely to die prematurely than those in the normal weight range. They are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, gallbladder problems, certain cancers, digestive disorders, breathing difficulties, fertility problems and depression,"" he says.
""Obesity is not simply a result of eating too much, it is a serious, chronic disease. There are many factors involved including eating and exercising habits, the genes you inherited from your parents, how well your body turns food into energy, your surrounds and psychological aspects.""
""That's why obesity needs to be treated by a team of specialists. Lifestyle intervention alone such as diet and exercise does not work for many chronic obesity cases. The overwhelming evidence is that bariatric surgery is an effective treatment.
""Most of my patients have tried all kinds of diets and weight loss medication without success. It's also very difficult for large people to exercise because their excessive weight puts a lot of strain on their joints.
""Weight-loss surgery works by restricting the amount of food the person can eat as well as reducing hunger hormones in the gut. However it is important that the surgery is performed in conjunction with lifestyle management to achieve significant and long-term weight loss.
""It has to be a team approach involving endocrinologists, dieticians, psychologists, exercise physiologists, nurse practitioners and general physicians who are trained in bariatric medicine,"" he says.
Dr Loi helped establish the multidisciplinary surgical weight-loss program at St George Private Hospital, a Centre of Bariatric Excellence.
He has performed more than 4000 bariatric operations and has been recognised as a 'surgeon of excellence'. The heaviest patient he has treated weighed 280 kilograms.
""For most patients, it's not just about the improvement in their medical condition,"" he says. ""Patient feedback on quality of life improvements is immeasurable.
""The father of one of my patients who lost 30 kilograms within six months of surgery, said: 'Thank you for giving my healthy and happy daughter back. Her insulin resistance is gone.' He invited me to her wedding next year.""
Dr Loi says sleeve gastrectomy is now the most commonly performed bariatric surgery in Australia and across the world.
It involves resecting a large portion (about 80 per cent) of the stomach and fashioning a smaller, tube-like stomach.
The patient's food intake is restricted and they feel satisfied and full after very small meals. The surgery ""resolves about 70 per cent of diabetes,"" says Dr Loi.

How little Alex saved mum's life
A YOUNG girl is being hailed as a hero for saving her mother's life after she was almost killed by an encounter with a chocolate cake.
Her mum Sara Beale, a type 1 diabetic, collapsed after she gave herself too much insulin so she could have a slice of her 7-year-old daughter's birthday cake.
The 34-year-old's blood glucose levels dropped dangerously low - known as hypoglycaemia - because the cake was not as sugary as she expected.
""I have an insulin pump and at meal times I look at what I am eating and its sugar content and give myself insulin accordingly. This time I took too much,"" she said.

Dogs on a plane a tough issue for owners in need
It's no exaggeration to say that, without her dogs, Monique Juniper could die.
A diabetic, Ms Juniper can experience debilitating crashes without warning, if it were not for her dog Luigi and the warning he gives when he smells that her glucose level is getting low.
Younger dog Nikolai is learning the trick. Both are classed as helper dogs, vital to her wellbeing, helping her to get around.
Ms Juniper is planning a trip to Sydney but is struggling to find an airline that will let her take her dogs with her on the plane, and cases like hers are part of a review of airline regulation occurring now.
""Every time I need to fly it's an absolute shit-fight,"" she says. ""It's discrimination.""
Three times recently, Ms Juniper says, she tried to book a flight for herself and her dogs with Tiger Airways.
She said the airline's call-centre staff told her each time that only guide dogs for the visually impaired were allowed on Tiger flights, despite the airline's stated policy of allowing assistance dogs from selected professional bodies, including the one that accredited Luigi.
After being contacted by Fairfax Media, Tiger spokeswoman Vanessa Regan said staff would be re-trained in the company's policy and that arrangements for Ms Juniper were being made.
According to the Australian Human Rights Commission, it is a breach of the Disability Discrimination Act for service providers to exclude people who need assistance unless ""unjustifiable hardship"" can be shown.
In the case of airlines, CASA regulations provide for dogs to accompany people who are either visually or hearing impaired. Other kinds of assistance dogs are to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In practice, this means that airlines are left to create their own policies.
Ms Juniper is also planning a trip to Darwin, and says she would like to fly with Qantas. She is finding this difficult as well. Her dogs are accredited by a body recognised by Tiger, but not by Qantas.
Such discrepancies in airline policy is another reason why Ms Juniper is angry.
""You pay a fare, and anyone can pay a fare, so why can't I just pay a fare like everyone else and go where I need to go,"" she says. ""Just because I'm disabled and need an assistance dog.""
The issue is being reviewed by airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
""CASA is developing a new set of general operating rules for Australian aviation,"" said spokesman Peter Gibson. ""The appropriate approach to the safety regulation of assistance animals carried on aircraft is being examined.""
Assistance Guide Dogs Australia chief executive Richard Lord said it could be difficult for airlines to manage requests for assistance dogs, since there is no universally accepted process for accreditation.
""It's a growth industry,"" he said. ""Twenty years ago, there might have been guide dogs and that was about it. Now there are assistance dogs for epileptics, for diabetics, for people with PTSD, for all kinds [of ailments]"".
And there are limitations. Tiger passengers, for example, can take with them only two dogs on any one plane.
""That usually never impacts us,"" said Ms Juniper. ""I've never been on another flight with another dog. Ever.""
Five things you didn't know a dog could do
1. Seizure assistance: Dogs help people who suffer from epilepsy.
They can be trained to break their human's fall in the event of a seizure.
2. Mobility assistance: Help with a range of tasks to make life easier for people in wheelchairs.

""I put on an awful lot of weight, my relationship broke up, then the feelings in my legs got worse.
Two years ago, I had the left leg amputated below the knee. Now my blood sugars are controlled. My diet's a lot better.
""I've probably lost 20 kilos. I was such an athletic person. I played football,"" he said.
As for his goal of walking again, Mr Robinson says: ""I am waiting for rehab with my prosthesis fitting."" He said that thanks to Dr Gary Fettke, who amputated his left leg, ""I have been able to keep my right leg so far.""

Pregnancy and diabetes link
PREGNANT women who are depressed are more likely to develop gestational diabetes and then suffer diabetes in later life.
An Australian study of 3000 pregnant women has also revealed a strong link between gestational diabetes, mental health, domestic violence and past sexual abuse.
The discoveries, published in journal BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, also revealed a gap in the health system, with many private patients not getting the depression test.
""This is the first time a study has shown if you book in for your pregnancy care with a higher score on the depression screening tool you have an increased chance to developing gestational diabetes,"" professor of midwifery Hannah Dahlen said. ""If you are feeling anxious or depressed, it is important that you talk to your doctor or midwife about it. It is not something that will go away.
""This is a wake-up call for the private sector, which has not started taking mental health seriously. None of these women... are being screened for psychological and social issues. They are not being asked about domestic violence, sexual abuse and mental health.""

Diva's diabetes plea
It's been no secret that Marcia Hines has been living with diabetes for the past 30 years.
It turns out she didn't discover she was a type 1 diabetic until she had a trip to the dentist, which resulted in some complications with healing and a visit to hospital
""For me, it was the best wake-up call I haven't gotten,"" she told AAA.
""I would've been in my 30s, and like all girls - you eat, you don't eat - you eat... and so what diabetes has done for me is made me far more conscious about what I put in.""
Fresh off a gruelling seven-month tour with her show Velvet, Hines manages her condition with an insulin pump and a healthy diet. She's also teamed up with Priceline Pharmacy, and is urging those who might have a niggling feeling something isn't right to head into a store where they can be tested and obtain advice on the disease.
""You have to be responsible for taking responsibility of yourself. No one else can be, you know?"" she said.
""It's incredible that people don't and it's rife. And so you can function, I suppose, until you can't function any longer.""
Hines is set to continue performing through to the end of the year with KC and the Sunshine Band and Boney M, and Day on the Green later in the year.

Back to the womb for a headstart on diabetes
THE head of the Prime Minister's national diabetes advisory group wants a greater focus on gestational diabetes, saying the condition puts mothers and children at a greater risk of diabetes in future.
Professor Paul Zimmet, co-chair of the expert group, said health experts needed to start as early as pregnancy if they were to lower the rate of diabetes in Australia in the future.
The advisory group is working on a national strategy to tackle the nation's diabetes epidemic, to be handed to the Federal Government this year.
""The children of mothers with gestational diabetes are more likely to develop diabetes themselves and this needs to be tackled quite strongly in any new national strategy,"" Professor Zimmet, director of the International Diabetes Institute, told The Courier-Mail.
""The seeds for developing Type 2 diabetes are sowed during the pregnancy, when the baby is in the womb.
""If we can help mothers with gestational diabetes we may be a chance of reducing the burden of diabetes 20 to 30 years down the track."" Prof Zimmet said he wanted to see more pre-pregnancy education for mothers-to-be, focusing on the importance of healthy eating and giving up cigarettes and alcohol during pregnancy. Nikki Kitchen, 27 (below), ate healthily while pregnant with daughter Olivia, 15 months, and said she was unlucky to have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

GPs fail asthma, diabetes patients
GENERAL practitioners are prescribing antibiotics for viruses and failing to properly care for asthma and diabetes patients and the elderly, a new report reveals.
As the government locks heads with doctors over a planned $5 cut to the Medicare rebate, the Productivity Commission's Report on Government Services raises questions about the standard of GP care.
It found one in three GPs prescribed antibiotics for upper respiratory viruses even though they don't work and their over-use is breeding resistant bugs.
Only a quarter of asthma patients have an asthma action plan drawn up by their GP; just 47 per cent of GP practices have signed up for a program to improve care of diabetes patients; only 31 per cent of 75-year-olds have had an in-depth assessment by their GP; and nearly half the nation's four-year-olds have not had their four-year-old health check.
The report comes just weeks after the government was forced to back down on its plan to stamp out so-called ""six minute medicine"" by cutting the Medicare rebate by $20.
It is also planning to cut the Medicare rebate by $5 from July and freeze indexation of the payment.
Australian Medical Association president Dr Brian Owler said the taxpayer was ""certainly getting value for money"" from GP care and that the number of preventable hospitalisations had fallen in the past five years. He said over 90 per cent of patients said their GP listened carefully to them, showed them respect and spent enough time with them. While he concedes more needs to be done to help GPs reduce antibiotic use, he said part of the problem was that patients don't understand that antibiotics only fight bacteria and not viruses.

Father calls for inquiry into death of country vet
The father of well-known Canberra region vet Dr Ella Ormes Lichacz is calling for an inquiry into whether the diabetes medication she was taking may have contributed to her sudden death in March. Dr Ormes Lichacz's death has sent shockwaves through the rural communities she served in and around the ACT from her base at Hall, with many friends and family left reeling by the unexpected death of the otherwise healthy 28-year-old. Dr Ormes Lichacz, a type 1 diabetic, was known for her extraordinary strength and ability to manage her condition, but was found convulsing and slipping into a diabetic coma on March 24. Her father, Wieslaw Lichacz, said given her extensive medical training and successful track record in managing her condition since childhood, it was extremely unlikely she had failed to take the appropriate dose and an investigation was needed to determine if the medication she was taking or the special insulin delivery pen played any role in her death. Mr Lichacz said his daughter's Levemir flexpen had been found beside her bed, and he had immediately tested it and others in her vehicle and found the dosage administered to be incorrect, with some doses well under the number of units dialled up. His results are yet to be verified by an official testing authority. ""I'm going to be requesting a coroner's inquest, because she was fine. She cooked a good dinner for our friends before she went to bed, I've seen security footage [from the vet practice] showing her lifting 60kg bags down the driveway, laughing and having a good time... it was a normal day,"" Mr Lichacz said. ""From my tests [the insulin pens] were delivering 50-70 per cent of the insulin they should have been, and the one at her bedside actually delivered zero, five times."" He also had concerns that the preservative in the slow-acting Levemir may have not functioned correctly, affecting the timing of the insulin's release. Novo Nordisk, manufacturers of the Levemir flexpen, has announced the phase-out of the product in some countries, to be replaced with a newer design known as the Flextouch, although the phase-out was not related to safety concerns. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has received 38 reports of adverse events up to January 16 this year associated with Levemir flexpens and one report of the device malfunctioning. ""There have been no reports of death where the person was using Levemir. The product has not been recalled in Australia and the product has been replaced by the sponsor in the United States with a new type of delivery system. There have been no recent recalls or alerts issued for insulin pens,"" a TGA spokesperson said. Due to the risk of infection and her work with sick animals, Dr Ormes Lichacz had not been able to monitor her blood sugar levels by pricking her fingertips, but Mr Lichacz said she had become extremely skilled at judging when her levels were too low or high and he did not believe she would have misjudged her levels. Fellow vet at Hall Jan Spate, who had known Dr Ormes Lichacz for more than a decade, said she shared the concerns that the matter needed to be investigated further. ""I've known her since she was 14, and she has always managed it very well. It seems wrong that someone with her knowledge of what was going on should have that happen,"" Dr Spate said. ""Occasionally she'd come in after working all day and say, 'I think I've got a bit of a low coming on', you wouldn't know it to look at her, but she could tell. ""I'm a bit suspicious that the insulin wasn't as good as it should have been, or that it wasn't giving the dose it should have been. Yes it's possible [that she got it wrong] but I'd certainly like to see it investigated,"" Dr Spate said. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the company took its obligations to safety extremely seriously and would fully co- operate with any coronial investigation into the death. ""The death of a young woman is a profoundly sad event, and our thoughts are with the family,"" the spokesman said in a statement. ""Novo Nordisk is committed to patient safety and continuously monitors the safety profiles of Levemir and FlexPen. Based on this monitoring, we have no grounds to suspect that any of our marketed products would not function as intended."" The spokesman said while the FlexTouch pens were being launched in some countries in combination with next generation insulin, they were not being launched in Australia at this time. Mr Lichacz said he did not want to raise unnecessary alarm among other diabetics using Levemir. ""But the important message is they need to check to make sure they are getting the right dose,"" he said.

Higher diabetes risk for IVF kids
CHILDREN who are conceived through IVF treatment face an increased risk of diabetes, new tests indicate.
University of Adelaide researchers have discovered the link 35 years after the birth of the first IVF baby.
The work, involving mice, was done by Associate Professor Leonie Heilbronn, Dr Linda Wu, Professor Gary Wittert, Professor Rob Norman and Dr Rebecca Robker.
It will be presented at the annual conference of the Endocrine Society of Australia in Sydney later this month.
Prof Heilbronn said there are now 5.5 million IVF babies worldwide. ""Studies in humans cannot separate out whether any differences in risk are due to genetics, environment, or the IVF procedure itself and so we aimed to establish a mouse model in the first instance,"" Prof Heilbronn said.
""Our results show that regardless of diet, IVF male mice showed an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, whereas only the female mice that ate a high-fat diet showed a higher susceptibility to the disease."" Prof Heilbronn said the team will continue to investigate the subject, including whether it is the process of growing the embryos in vitro that causes the effects, or whether it is hormones given to women prior to obtaining their eggs that increases risk factors.
""IVF has helped to solve an age-old issue of infertility and it is important that we continue to build on the knowledge we currently have to build a healthier future for generations to come,"" Prof Heilbronn said ""There is still so much research to be done and our team will begin the next stage of our study to investigate if these issues can be prevented during the in vitro culture process.
""There are a lot of positive signs to show that by changing IVF practices, such as lessening hormone exposure or freezing embryos, we may be able to prevent these issues from arising later in life."" The study used mice to mimic IVF programs as used with humans, and compared it to a controlled group of mice conceived naturally. The offspring at adolescence were given either a regular diet or high fat diet for eight weeks. When they reached adulthood they were assessed for type 2 diabetes risk similar to tests in humans.

Global diabetes epidemic 'worse than we thought'
The diabetes epidemic is worse than previously thought, according to experts who say inconsistent and inadequate testing has caused a severe underestimation of the disease's prevalence.
A new paper co-written by Australian diabetes researchers warns there could be 100 million more people with diabetes globally than previously thought, with about 300,000 more Australians likely to have the disease.
Monash University professor and co-author Paul Zimmet said the research should act as a ""wake-up call"" for government when deciding how much to invest in future prevention and treatment.
""It does have implications in Australia because the government relies on data from the ABS and the method they use is not the best method, so it probably underestimates the problem of diabetes by about 25 per cent,"" Professor Zimmet said.
He said data that suggested about 5 per cent of Australians had elevated blood sugar levels predisposing them to diabetes should be revised upwards to a more realistic figure of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. It could be as high as 30 per cent among indigenous Australians.
Diagnosing pre-diabetes is critical for preventing the disease taking hold. The paper, published in Nature Reviews, calls for international consensus on uniform standards and criteria for recording diabetes figures and standardised criteria for recognising and reporting complications. The number of people with type-2 diabetes has more than doubled in the past 20 years, but Professor Zimmet said it was still underestimated by 25 per cent; pre-diabetes was likely underestimated by 50 per cent.

A spoonful of venom helps the sugar go down
Venom from two iconic Australian species could be behind the development of new treatments for diabetes, which affects about 1.7 million Australians.
A team of scientists has found that platypus and echidna venom contains a long-lasting version of the hormone GLP-1, which is responsible for releasing insulin to lower blood glucose levels.
The same hormone is produced and released in the human gut, but it is not so stable and degrades within minutes.
Adelaide University evolutionary biologist Frank Grutzner said the longer lifespan of the hormone found in the animal venom raised the potential to develop drugs that extend the release of insulin in type 2 diabetes patients.
""This will prove useful for biomedical research, as there is a lot of potential there,"" he said. ""The hormone is central to metabolic control.""
Like humans and other vertebrates, the platypus and echidna also produce the GLP-1 hormone, known as glucagon-like peptide-1, in their gut to control blood sugar levels.
In people with type 2 diabetes, the short stimulus triggered by the hormone is insufficient to maintain proper blood sugar levels. To manage this, medication that includes a longer-lasting form of the hormone is taken to extend the body's release of insulin.
Because the hormone found in the animals' venom doesn't degrade as rapidly, researchers are hopeful that this will lead to the development of new drugs to manage diabetes in humans.
According to Diabetes Australia, about 280 Australians develop diabetes every day.
Researchers, including medical biochemist Briony Forbes from Flinders University, admitted they were surprised to find the hormone was not only active in the gut but in monotreme venom as well.
The fact that the hormone had evolved in monotremes as something that could both regulate blood glucose and fend off rival males, depending on where in the body it was released, also stunned researchers. ""That wasn't something that we expected,"" Professor Grutzner said.
Echidnas have a venom gland but they do not have a spur and the venom's purpose is something of a mystery.
Male platypuses fight for mating rights during the breeding season and can spike a rival with a poisoned spur found on the heel of their back legs. The venom enters the bloodstream, but the poisoned animal has the ability to degrade it.
""It's remarkable that they can firstly produce a more stable hormone and then, secondly, that they have the ability to degrade it,"" Professor Grutzner said.
""If you put the hormone into blood from a human or a mouse, it wouldn't degrade.""
The findings have been published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports.

Ignore diabetes risk at your peril
It's National Diabetes Week, therefore a timely reminder of everything you need to know about one of Australia's most common complex conditions. There are three types of diabetes - type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes - and all are increasing. The most common, type 2, is the fastest increasing, associated with modifiable lifestyle risk factors (especially obesity) and strong genetic and family-related risk factors. And don't assume all cases of diabetes are easily managed, perhaps with a new diet or insulin injection: diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults, a cause of kidney failure, and increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke. In 2011, according to statistics released this year, it was estimated that about 730,000 Australians had diagnosed diabetes. Of those, 1.7 per cent (12,3000) had lower limbs amputated as a result.
Type 2 diabetes can creep up on people yet only 5 per cent of Australians aged over 40 have had a risk check in the past two years, and more than half of all people are unable to name any diabetes-related conditions - even though they may be at risk. Diabetes Australia, which commissioned the research, has launched a new campaign, It's About Time, to urge the suspected 500,000 Australians living with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes to get checked.
""Many people have type 2 diabetes for up to seven years before being diagnosed and during that time up to half begin to develop a diabetes-related complication,"" says Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson. ""The tragedy is much of the damage (from) diabetes-related complications like vision loss, kidney damage, heart attack, stroke and limb amputation is preventable."" Johnson recommends AUSDRISK, a free, online risk assessment that takes only five minutes. Remember, the earlier you address your risk factors or get a diagnosis, the better the outcomes are likely to be.
Mothers who gain weight in the months and years leading up to pregnancy have an increased risk of gestational diabetes, even if they otherwise may be considered to be of healthy weight. Researchers tracked more than 3000 participants in the Women's Health Australia study and found women with only a small weight gain each year (1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent of body weight) doubled their risk of gestational diabetes. ""Even women who were underweight or in the normal BMI range had an increased risk of gestational diabetes when they gained weight - even if they remained within the healthy weight category,"" University of Queensland school of public health researcher Akilew Adane says, suggesting a possible link with progressive insulin resistance.
A separate study, led by the University of Adelaide and published last year, found women whose babies were conceived in winter were likelier to develop gestational diabetes.
An international study led by the Australian National University has bolstered calls for a sugar tax to reduce soft drink consumption. Researcher Keren Papier says the Thai Cohort Study looked at habits and risk factors of nearly 40,000 adults in Thailand. ""Over 4000 cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented annually in the Thai population if people avoided drinking sugary drinks daily,"" Papier says. ""Thai women (with lower muscle mass and energy needs than men) would be the main beneficiaries.""
Research from the George Institute, published in Nutrients, shows how Australians face a greater risk of obesity. Between 1995 and 2012, portion sizes increased so dramatically that pizza and cake recorded a 66 per cent increase in the average number of kilojoules consumed in one sitting. ""We found foods that provide very little nutritional benefit have surged in size, and this is helping to fuel Australia's obesity epidemic,"" says the institute's Miaobing Zheng.

New saliva test could have diabetes licked
Medicine: The development of a low-cost, saliva-based glucose test using a 2D printer could make blood tests a thing of the past for diabetics.
The Australian-developed needle-free test detects concentrations of glucose and is up to 100 times more sensitive than current blood sensors.
The easy-to-use test integrates biosensors or chemical signatures into printed transistors.
The usual way of testing for glucose relies on a finger prick to draw blood for testing.
""It could work in a number of possible ways but the most futuristic way, which would be kind of cool, is you might just print your own sensor on your inkjet printer at home,"" the University of Newcastle's Paul Dastoor said.
""You would get a cartridge potentially that you could print on a little piece of plastic, cut it out and lick it. I expect it will plug into a low-cost reader."" The patented innovation was created by Professor Dastoor and his team at the University's Centre of Organic Electronics.
""I think the cost of each device would be less than a cent,"" he said. The team has been focused on the development of new electronic devices at the intersection between semiconductors and plastics.
The development of a paint with semiconducting particles means electronic designs can now be downloaded and printed relatively cheaply from an inkjet printer. The saliva-based test of glucose levels for diabetic patients was developed using a reel to reel printer.
Electrical components can be printed using an ink that is a semiconductor. After mixing in an enzyme, it will assess glucose levels when a diabetic places a sample of their saliva on the test.
Sensors that can identify different chemical signatures also have potential in many other fields.
Professor Dastoor said the current stage of development involved correlating real devices with actual saliva measurements.
""Where we are now then is having the ability to create a really low-cost sensor that we can print enormous quantities of, which would be sensitive to glucose in your saliva,"" he said. ""So rather than diabetics having to stab themselves four to six times a day, you would just be able to lick."" A non-invasive test for diabetics has been the Holy Grail in diabetes research for decades with tattoos, sensors and breathalysers among the current methods being developed.
Professor Dastoor said the most recent work had shown conclusively that the glucose levels in saliva were highly correlated with blood glucose.
""So, yes, I think it is a viable approach."" There are expected to be 500 million people with diabetes by 2030. Professor Dastoor, who has been working on the project since 2007, said it was possible to integrate other low-cost electronic components.
""One of those might be, for example, a wireless sender built into the device itself. Then you have got the prospect of a reader that could readily communicate with your mobile phone,"" he said. ""You could lick the test and just ask your phone 'what was my blood glucose reading?' ""Professor Dastoor, who expects to get to commercial prototypes in about two years, plans to spin-out the technology from the university and gain further investment.

The complications of diabetes take time, sometimes decades, to manifest but they are severe and irreversible, meaning prevention must start on the first day of diagnosis.
Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness, amputations and impotence and has a hand in 9 per cent of all deaths in Australia. In 2012 the Australian Bureau of Statistics listed it as the sixth top cause of death.
""When you really start to think about (the consequences), you realise that diabetes can - and will - kill you if you ignore it,"" Helen Mitchell, health services general manager at Diabetes WA, said. ""It is a silent disease that slowly takes pot shots at damaging organs over time.""
Active self-management was needed to prevent or delay the onset of additional health problems.
Whatever form, type 1 or 2, the complications are the same, however, they can be avoided by keeping blood glucose levels within the optimal range, which is usually 4-8 mmol/L fasting or as agreed with your GP and health professional team.
Unmanaged diabetes and frequently straying outside the optimal blood glucose levels risked nerve damage, also known as peripheral neuropathy, and poor circulation or peripheral arterial disease in the lower limbs.
This leaves people not only less likely to feel that they have hurt their feet but means they also take far longer to heal, making them susceptible to ulcers and infections. Treatment can be difficult and for some their only option is amputation.
More than one in six diabetics will develop diabetic retinopathy, a condition where small blood vessels in the eye become damaged causing vision loss and blindness. They are also at higher risk of glaucoma and cataracts.
Cardiovascular disease is one of the main complications of diabetes, with those diagnosed four times more likely to have a stroke or a heart attack.
High levels of glucose damage the blood-filtering capillaries in the kidneys which can cause diabetic nephropathy and potentially end-stage kidney disease where to survive patients must either go on dialysis or undergo a transplant.
Ms Mitchell acknowledged managing diabetes did take a lot of effort and could be exhausting.
""You are constantly checking your blood glucose levels, thinking about what you've eaten, when you plan to eat, how much physical activity you're doing. And no, it isn't enjoyable to think about this every single day,"" she said.
Ms Mitchell said plenty of young people under the age of 30 were being admitted to hospitals for diabetes- related complications, including foot ulcers, kidney disease and retinopathy.
It was important people worked with their health-care team to manage the condition and ensure they had the recommended checks on eyes, kidney function, feet, blood glucose levels, heart and even teeth.
She said it was a concern that, as revealed in one survey, people still did not think type 2 was a serious condition. ""Diabetes is a serious and lifelong condition, no matter which type you have. From my experience I think that perhaps the reason goes back to people thinking that because type 2 can be controlled by diet and lifestyle, that it isn't all that grave.""
Ms Mitchell said more funding was needed to kick-start awareness campaigns to push the prevention message.

World-class remote health boost
Alice Springs mother Nellie Impu is part of a grim health statistic profoundly out of place in a first-world nation: one in five pregnant Aboriginal women in the Northern Territory has diabetes.
For pre-existing type 2 diabetes, that's at a rate 10 times higher than for non-indigenous women; more common gestational diabetes is 1.5 times the rate.
Mrs Impu became part of that statistic almost five years ago when she was pregnant with son Wayne. So the announcement of a new central Australian academic health science centre, led by the Aboriginal community-controlled health service sector and bringing together a consortium of 11 clinical and research groups, is a big deal for her and many women like her.
The diabetes treatment she underwent while carrying Wayne will continue for more than a decade as part of a longitudinal study.
""We know there is a link between mums with diabetes in pregnancy and outcomes for their babies as they grow, including future possibilities of type 2 diabetes, which work like this can help us track,"" said research nurse Paula Van Dokkum, who works with consortium member Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute.
Wayne is meeting all his childhood development targets, and his mother said the ongoing association with the centre would help her in ""trying to make sure he grows up healthy and strong"".
Announcing $222,000 in seed funding, federal Indigenous Health Minister Ken Wyatt said the centre's accreditation this week with the National Health and Medical Research Council proved the ""landmark research"" by consortium members had ""huge potential"" to address serious indigenous health issues.
""The objective is to evaluate problems and find practical solutions fast, to prevent health problems and give speedy but lasting benefits to patients within community,"" Mr Wyatt said.
The academic health science centre model, well established internationally, brings together health services, universities and medical research institutes to better produce evidence-based care.
The Alice Springs-based enterprise will aim to tackle a cancer-causing virus endemic in indigenous central Australia, its only significant instance outside South America and central Africa.
The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 causes a slow death over 20 years with leukaemia, chronic cough, respiratory problems and respiratory failure. It can be acquired through breast milk in early childhood as well as through blood or sexual contact.
A recent study found HTLV-1 infection rates in a central Australian indigenous community of more than 40 per cent. One result, the inflammatory disease bronchiectasis, is a leading cause of death for young adults at the Alice Springs hospital.
The program will also address the soaring demand for dialysis in remote communities, with indigenous Australians five times as likely to have end-stage kidney disease than other Australians.
Alice Springs hospital is home to the largest single-standing dialysis service in the southern hemisphere, with 360 patients.

Nervous system 'can fight diabetes'
Perth researchers believe the part of the body that controls the ""fight or flight response"" could help ward off type 2 diabetes.
They hope to harness the sympathetic nervous system, which helps accelerate the heart rate and boosts blood pressure, to improve blood sugar levels.
This could help to reduce rates of diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes, and even treat heart disease.
University of WA researchers have shown for the first time that the sympathetic nervous system helps to regulate a protein called SGLT2, which controls the body's glucose levels.
Diabetes Research WA executive director Sherl Westlund said $80,000 had been awarded to the team. They include UWA school of medicine and pharmacology Assistant Professor Vance Matthews and Professor Markus Schlaich from Royal Perth Hospital's Dobney Hypertension Centre.
Ms Westlund said the race was on to find new ways to prevent the avalanche of type 2 diabetes cases that was expected in the next few years.
Professor Matthews said the research had the potential to provide a fresh approach to treating obesity and type 2 diabetes by improving blood sugar levels.
""We've recently generated exciting data which highlights for the first time that the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in regulating the major glucose reabsorption protein - sodium glucose co-transporter 2 or SGLT2- which is believed to be expressed exclusively in the kidney,"" he said.
""The focus of this grant is to find out if we can develop ways to tap into the sympathetic nervous system and alter the expression of this protein. If we can do that, it opens up new avenues for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.""
Researchers hope their work will explain how the glucose-lowering medication empagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.
If it is found to be acting on the sympathetic nervous system as thought, it could become a new drug treatment for cardiovascular disease.

Department warned on diabetic children
Education - 'Misleading' policy creates risks
The Victorian Education Department is breaching its duty of care to children with type 1 diabetes, and its ""misleading"" policy could have potentially catastrophic consequences, according to one of Australia's top law firms.
The damning legal opinion was sought after the department refused to provide a qualified aide for a five-year-old boy whose highly complex medical needs require his blood-sugar levels to be tested every two hours and his insulin dose adjusted accordingly via a pump.
Law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler said the department's position was that children with type 1 diabetes were required to manage the demands of the potentially life-threatening condition themselves at school. Teachers were not obliged to assist, but also not discouraged, with the department's policy stating: ""Teachers are under no obligation to administer insulin or glucagon.""
However, Peter Seidel, a partner in public-interest law at the firm, said the policy effectively left it to teachers to make decisions about whether to administer the drugs. He said the policy did not make it clear that it was illegal for teachers without the appropriate qualifications to administer insulin or glucagon.
Mr Seidel, who is also an adjunct professor of law at La Trobe University, said even medically trained ambulance paramedics were prevented from administering insulin.
""There are potentially catastrophic consequences that could arise from the misleading nature of the DEECD [Department of Education and Early Childhood Development] policy,"" he wrote.
This was disputed by department deputy secretary Sonia Sharp. ""There is no legal requirement... that we are aware of which requires that insulin or glucagon be administered solely by a registered medical practitioner or registered nurse practitioner,"" she wrote in a letter to the family.
Tamara Boyer said her son's insulin dose needed to be constantly adjusted to prevent his blood sugar going too low or high. ""Type 1 diabetes is a constant tightrope walk, with the potential of life-threatening adverse events at every point in any day,"" Ms Boyer said. ""If he wants to eat something, you have to enter the exact carbohydrate value of the item into the pump and it gives insulin to match what he's eating. If he's playing Auskick, you have to turn the insulin down, and on a hot day, you have to turn the insulin down.""
Ms Boyer said if her son's blood sugar dropped too low, he would ""potentially become unconscious and [have a] fit, and that's when they call an ambulance"". Too high, and after several hours his organs could fail, leading to a coma and death.
The boy, who is at kindergarten this year, has a permanent nurse funded by the department. However, the family was initially told a qualified medical aide would not be provided when he started primary school next year.

BITE-SIZE SCIENCE WILL PUT NEW IDEAS ON TABLE
DIABETES researchers, patients and interested bystanders will be tucking in to a superb spread of science at the Australian Society for Medical Research Week dinner, to be held tonight.
Novel uses of stem cells for wound healing and the 3D printing of replacement insulin-producing islet cells are among the exciting future treatments for diabetes to be announced at the sold-out public event at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.
Four experts will speak on their areas of expertise including future therapies, wound healing, nutrition and community support.

A global, weighty issue
DIABETES is a worldwide epidemic with some truly frightening statistics. If diabetes was a country, it would be the third largest country in the world with about 370 million inhabitants.
That's how many people across the globe suffer diabetes - and the number is skyrocketing.
Diabetes Australia (Vic) chief executive Prof Greg Johnson says the number of people living with diabetes both in Australia and around the world is truly shocking.
In Australia alone there are more than 1.5 million people with diabetes, including about 100,000 people who developed the disease in the past year. That's a rate of almost 280 people a day.
""Then there's the other staggering figure that more than two million people in Australia have pre-diabetes, which is a state where you have already got abnormal glucose metabolism on the way to developing type-2 diabetes - you are at high risk of getting type two diabetes."" The theme of Thursday's World Diabetes Day is Protect Your Future - a theme which Prof Johnson has two meanings.
The first, for those who have diabetes, is to take the disease seriously and do everything they can to control it and avoid the potential complications from diabetes which include blindness, amputation, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and more.
The second is for those not diagnosed with diabetes to take the simple AUSDRISK diabetic risk assessment test and take responsibility for their lifestyle actions to reduce the risk.
If the test reveals you are at high risk for developing diabetes, you should see your doctor for a blood test.
""You can't wait for symptoms to appear. You can have type-2 diabetes that is silent for years and years. It can be silent and undiagnosed,"" he says. ""This epidemic shows no sign of slowing down in Australia... and is still underestimated in the community."" People with pre-diabetes can make diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to avoid or delay the onset of type-2 diabetes.
Unhealthy weight gain, even a couple of kilograms, poses a risk as does sedentary lifestyle, diet and genetic predisposition, Prof Johnson says.
WHAT IS DIABETES?
IN people with diabetes, blood glucose levels are higher than normal because the body does not produce enough insulin, cannot use insulin properly or a combination of both. The body needs insulin to help convert glucose into energy.
Type-1 diabetes: Is an auto-immune condition where the immune system destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. It is controlled using insulin injections or an insulin pump. The cause is unknown. Type-1 diabetes is not linked to modifiable lifestyle factors and cannot be prevented.
Type-2 diabetes: Occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin does not work effectively, or the cells of the body do not respond to insulin effectively. The cause is unknown but type-2 diabetes is associated with modifiable lifestyle risk factors. Type-2 diabetes also runs in families. It is controlled with lifestyle changes, oral medications and/or insulin injections.
Gestational diabetes: Occurs in about 5	 per cent of pregnancies and disappears after birth. It is more common in women over 25 years of age, overweight, those with a family history of type-2 diabetes or who have had gestational diabetes previously.
Pre-diabetes: is where blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type-2 diabetes. People with pre-diabetes are at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes in the next five years. Take the AUSDRISK - the Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Test - to assess your risk of developing diabetes. The AUSDRISK test is at diabetesvic.org.au

Our secret coastal killer
A POCKET of the Fraser Coast is home to more than triple the average number of diabetics in Australia.
In the 4659 postcode, 17.1 per cent of people are living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, well above the national average of 5 per cent.
Weipa, Camooweal and suburbs near Murgon, Mackay and Gayndah also had shockingly high figures, as did areas near Roma and Rockhampton.
In the southeast corner of the state, Bribie Island, Kippa-Ring, Stradbroke Island, Russell and Macleay islands, Silkstone, Dinmore, Inala, Rocklea, Acacia Ridge and Park Ridge were all above the national average.
Type 2 diabetes accounts for 85 per cent of the cases and the majority of those are preventable with a healthy lifestyle.
""Even having the average 5 per cent is horrific,"" Diabetes Queensland chief executive officer Michelle Trute said.
""We are getting really tolerant of looking at people who aren't in their healthy weight range and it's giving us a skewed sense of our security in regards to our own health."" There are more than 1.176 million Australians registered with the National Diabetes Services Scheme, which mapped the data, with 280 new cases registering daily.
""One of the drivers in places like the Fraser Coast and Bundaberg and up into the Cairns region is a lot of the retirees from southern states... decide to live there. The older the population is, the higher their risk of Type 2 diabetes,"" Ms Trute said.
""It's as though people think it's inevitable that they're going to end up old and with Type 2 diabetes and they can't prevent it. That attitude is what is going to cripple the health system."" Of all the state's primary health networks, data shows Brisbane South cares for the most diabetics.
It also shows Queensland has 45 cases for every 1000 people, significantly behind worst-performing South Australia, which has 58 per 1000.
Diabetes can lead to limb amputation, blindness, heart conditions and stroke and it's considered the ""gatekeeper"" for many chronic conditions. It's estimated about 93,000 Queenslanders are living with undiagnosed diabetes.

When to be concerned
Many women worry unnecessarily about the wrong things and pay too little attention to issues that can genuinely harm their baby. Here are some of the more serious complications and the signs to look out for. Gestational diabetes Pre-eclampsia Ectopic pregnancy Placenta previa Premature labour Placenta abruption
Gestational diabetes
Diabetes is a condition in which blood sugar (glucose) levels are high. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance that is first diagnosed during pregnancy.
It is a temporary condition that usually disappears after pregnancy.
The obstetrician says: ""Everyone should be screened for this in one way or another at about 28 weeks.
""There will be some girls who are at risk due to strong family risks of diabetes and who should be more cautious from early on and do all the right things from early on.""
The midwife says: ""For the general healthy woman, certainly a small percentage develop gestational diabetes but most women are tested for it in pregnancy and then it's managed well. It is about seeking help early and listening to your care providers.
""A lot of it is about healthy diet and exercising and maintaining good blood sugar levels, which those women will be taught about. It's only if those things aren't done that there can be serious risks for mum and baby.""",W17NN020

Diabetic sufferers risk limb removal
EACH day 12 Australians with diabetes lose entire limbs and parts of their feet in largely preventable amputations.
Not only does the extreme surgical intervention reduce the quality and length of patients' lives, it's a significant burden on the health system.
Diabetes Australia CEO Professor Greg Johnson said yesterday at least 85 per cent of amputations are preventable.
He said poor blood flow means that, for a diabetic, a stubbed toe or ulcer can quickly turn into a wound that doesn't heal and eventually needs amputation. ""It's a staggering number: 4400 amputations every year in Australia and that's just the tip of the iceberg because there are also more than 10,000 admissions to hospitals for diabetic foot problems,"" Prof Johnson said.
There is an average of 1450 amputations in NSW annually with patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes - with a lack of a nationally consistent approach to the problem largely to blame.
""We shouldn't be cutting off people's toes and limbs because of confusion and a divide between state and federal governments,"" Prof Johnson said. Amputations could be reduced or even eliminated if the fragmented system was replaced by a national system that included regular checks.

The cost of diabetes
A diagnosis will strike the hip pocket but scrimping can leave a terrible legacy. PETA RASDIEN reports.
Do you fill a prescription or put food on the table? Pay an overdue bill or visit the specialist?
These are the choices diabetics will struggle with when budgets are tight.
While cutting corners on care might seem a solution to immediate cash-flow problems, experts warn the long-term impact on your health is just not worth it.
A diabetes diagnosis can hit the hip pocket hard, forcing people to find on average an extra $4025 annually for people with type 2 diabetes without complications, rising to $9645 in people with both micro and macro-vascular complications.
For type 1 diabetes, the average financial outlay is $3468 for people without complications, although this can surge to $16,698 for people with both micro and macro-vascular complications, according to a Baker IDI report in 2012.
This could explain why 24 per cent of Australians with chronic conditions, including diabetes, report not receiving care or attending their doctor because of cost.
But Professor Merlin Thomas, head of biochemistry of diabetes complications at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, said scrimping on equipment or doctor's visits could leave a terrible legacy in terms of diabetes complications that can include cardiovascular disease and kidney problems.
Failing to keep specialist appointments could also mean people missed out on opportunities to try new drugs and devices that could deliver a better quality of life.
Every person diagnosed with diabetes is registered to the National Diabetes Services Scheme which provides subsidised syringes and needles, blood glucose test strips, urine ketone test strips and insulin pump consumables to people with diabetes but there are still significant out-of-pocket costs.
New technology such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices have the potential to save lives and make controlling diabetes far better and easier but for most diabetics they are financially out of reach.
For the 10 per cent of West Australians now using an insulin pump, which cost about $10,000, the full out-of-pocket costs of necessary consumables such as infusion sets and reservoirs/cartridges is around $270 per month. Although the cost of pumps can be covered by private health insurance or subsidised by some government programs depending on the patient, and there are programs to subsidise consumables for some people.
Continuous glucose monitors, which have been hailed a major breakthrough in diabetes self-management, cost about $5000 a year to operate and there are no rebates from Medicare or private health funds.
The Federal Government has committed to subsidising CGMs for people aged under 21, although details of the program are yet to be finalised and rolled out.

Diabetes launch
Families tackling the daily challenges for the 1200 WA children with type 1 diabetes will get plenty of support from a new $2.8 million centre in Perth's northern suburbs.
The Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre, which opened yesterday and works with Princess Margaret Hospital's diabetes team, is the first of its kind in Australia.
It is not only a place to give treatment but also somewhere to share information and offer advice to ensure families do not feel isolated. General manager Rebecca Johnson, who was diagnosed with type 1 in her teens, said the Stirling centre would provide a layer of peer and psychosocial support for the entire family, including that of 16-month-old Jack Hayes, who was diagnosed about six months ago.
""This centre is a new model of care,"" Ms Johnson said.
""It involves moving from hospital-based care to a family-friendly community centre where people will be able to feel at ease.""
The centre is aimed at children aged up to 18 because type 1 is a ""round-the-clock disease"" tackled in a team effort between families and the community.
Ms Johnson said misconceptions about type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which were fundamentally different, were common.
""Type 1 is an autoimmune disease that cannot be prevented or cured and is not caused by eating too much sugar,"" she said.
More than 100 children are diagnosed each year, often affecting their whole family.

A lifestyle warning
MORE than two million adult Australians are on the verge of developing diabetes and severe ongoing health problems unless they make changes to their lifestyle.
As 10,000 of the world's top diabetes experts descend on Melbourne next week, many warn we are a nation on the verge of disaster, with 1.7 million already suffering diabetes.
While millions more are suffering pre-diabetes - with blood glucose levels placing them on the tipping point of the disease - new research from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute shows it is not too late for most to avoid severe health issues with early intervention.
The research, to be discussed at the World Diabetes Congress in Melbourne from Monday, shows those with pre-diabetes are able to cut their chances of progressing to full diabetes by more than half within three years by overhauling their diet and lifestyle.
""If they do nothing and progress to diabetes, they face all the issues that go along with that - eye disease, foot disease, kidney problems, the likely need for extra medication,"" Baker's Associate Professor Jonathan Shaw said.
More than two million Australians over 25 have pre-diabetes, making them 15 times more likely to suffer diabetes than those with a normal blood glucose levels.

She has overhauled her life with the help of a health education team, including walking more than 1550km across France and Spain in the past three years and regularly treading Melbourne through her love of street art.

VICTORIA'S $127M HEALTH CHECK-UP
THE Napthine Government will inject more than $100 million into health programs to try and halt a rising tide of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and chronic health conditions.
The unprecedented public health splurge comes as a new report shows that the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes will rise, while obesity rates are soaring.
Half of Victoria's adult population is now overweight or obese. While the diabetes rate appears to have levelled off, the number of Victorians with Type 2 diabetes is likely to increase as the population ages.
A re-elected Coalition will spend $127 million on health prevention and promotion strategies including $22 million to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease and $40 million for primary and preventive healthcare.
More than $35 million will also be invested in anti-smoking programs and regional health services, plus $2.8 million will be given to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to expand in the Wimmera, East Gippsland and North East.
Premier Denis Napthine said the funding boost would support important programs which tackle chronic illnesses.
The funding pledge comes after the most comprehensive check-up of the state's health revealed areas of Victoria are eating so poorly that fewer than one in 30 residents consumes the recommended amount of vegetables.
Just one in 13 eats enough to meet the minimum standards to remain healthy. But while most Victorians are turning their backs on healthy food, one in five guzzles soft drink every day and most are downing almost 600ml. Mildura residents average more than a litre each.
Victorians are also ignoring fruit, with less than half the population eating enough to meet daily guidelines.
As a result 17.3 per cent of Victoria's population are now considered obese - jumping more than a quarter in a decade - and a further 32.5 per cent are overweight.
Deakin University public health professor Boyd Swinburn said Victoria was moving in the wrong direction.
""Obesity and diabetes is going up and that's a real problem. Fruit and vegetable intake is particularly low and a very high proportion of people are drinking sugar-sweetened drink on a regular basis - it adds up to an expensive health system needed to fix up the mess,"" Prof Swinburn said.
""In a global sense Australia is doing pretty well in areas like heart disease and life expectancy, but when it comes to diabetes, body weight and healthy eating, we are not doing very well at all."" Based on detailed interviews with 33,673 Victorians across the state's 79 local government areas during 2011-12, the latest Victorian Population Health Survey report seen by the Herald Sun reveals a glaring disparity between the health of city dwellers and those living in the country.
With increased rates of obesity, smoking, problem drinking and unhealthy diets in poorer regional areas, the department found country residents are hurting themselves.
Following the release of Victoria's last Population Health Survey in 2011, the Coalition Government launched its Healthy Together Victoria program, which saturated the most troubled areas of the state with grassroots preventive health programs.
The new cash boost includes $20 million to continue that program. Prof Swinburn said it was achieving results, but it would take years for the benefits to filter through.
In the latest report more than one in five Victorians complained that fruit and vegetables were too costly.

Hidden gene clue to diabetes 
WA researchers have helped to discover a hidden ""obesity gene"" that could change how type 2 diabetes is diagnosed and treated.
The previously unrecognised gene is one of a few now linked to insulin resistance and high blood-sugar levels.
It adds weight to the theory that obesity and lack of exercise are not the only culprits contributing to the explosion in type 2 diabetes.
Almost 100,000 West Australians, or one in 25 people, have type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes experts meeting in Melbourne this week announced the finding from the Australian-pioneered Gene Mine, which is being used to uncover genes responsible for a range of diseases.
Using specially bred mice from eight genetic backgrounds, Dr Sof Andrikopoulos from Melbourne University worked with Professor Grant Morahan from Perth's Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research to measure body weight, blood glucose and insulin sensitivity.
They found several genes that together increased susceptibility to obesity and the body's inability to respond to naturally occurring insulin.
Dr Andrikopoulos said the research should prompt a rethink on how type 2 diabetes was classified and treated.
""Firstly, we need to stop oversimplifying type 2 diabetes as a condition caused by excessive weight and a sedentary lifestyle, because there are many genetic factors that predispose people to diabetes,"" he said.
""Secondly, we need to rethink our approach to treatment because current medicines that increase the body's production of insulin may do more harm than good in people with type 2 diabetes.""
Professor Morahan said the diabetes genetic find was likely to be the first from the Gene Mine.
""We are looking at genes that prevent or delay melanoma, genes that cause heart attacks in young people and ones that can prevent dementia,"" he said. ""It's not single genes that cause diseases but a series of genetic variances.""
The Australian Diabetes Society and Australian Diabetes Educators Association annual scientific meeting has been told that more than one million Australians have undiagnosed diabetes.
A study by Melbourne's Austin Hospital found that more than one-third of patients aged 54 and over had diabetes.
Of these, 15 per cent had not been diagnosed.

Epidemic of truly global proportions
Guy Barnett warns of an enormous problem emerging across the planet
As Western lifestyles go global with improving standards of living in many countries, we are facing a type 2 diabetes epidemic.
China has 109 million adults with type 2 diabetes and India has 69 million. Four out of every five adults with diabetes are from the developing world. The latest figures released at the World Diabetes Congress in Vancouver show 415 million adults with diabetes and a further 318 million with pre-diabetes in the high-risk category.
The statistics are frightening.
Five million people died from diabetes in 2015, more than AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined - one person every six seconds.
Experts predict that by 2040 there will be 642 million adults with diabetes. The amazing truth is that in many cases type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented altogether from healthier lifestyles and medication.
Risk factors include excess body weight, physical inactivity, poor nutrition, genetics, family history, past history of gestational diabetes and older age.
It seems that year-by-year we are living in a more ""obesogenic"" environment, which encourages sedentary living and poor nutrition.
My recent visit to North America was in some ways overwhelming because it was so difficult to find healthy food and drink choices.
The diet options were heavy in carbohydrates and high in salt, fat and sugar. The US is now the fattest nation on Earth, and for good reason. Sadly, Australia is not far behind as the fourth fattest.
Indigenous populations around the globe have a three to six times higher risk of type 2 diabetes. This requires dedicated initiatives.
The latest global health costs of diabetes are between US$673 billion and US$1.197 trillion per year.
However, the diabetes epidemic is not just a health issue but a development issue.
If working-age adults across the globe are sick or unable to work due to diabetes complications - such as amputations and eye, liver or heart disease - then economic development is thwarted.
The good news is the 66th World Health Assembly has agreed to ""halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025"".
This target was supported by the Australian Government. Having a target is one thing, however achieving it is another.
Across the globe we need to turn Western lifestyles into healthy lifestyles. The same goes for Tasmania.
We need to start a conversation about how to achieve better health outcomes and health prevention measures, and then act. With a change in culture and behaviour, better outcomes are possible.
The Parliamentarians for Diabetes Global Network is committed to advocate for all people with diabetes, their families and those at risk.
This includes 500,000 children across the globe with type 1 diabetes - a different disease to type 2 diabetes, which has no known cure.
Sadly, thousands of children in developing countries die each year from this disease because they cannot access or afford insulin.
The Life for a Child Program, supported by the International Diabetes Federation, supplies insulin to 17,000 children in 46 countries every year.
Congratulations should go to Stephanie Cecile for being elected to the executive of the young leaders program in Vancouver.
We need advocates supporting the diabetes community in Tasmania and worldwide. Guy Barnett is the Liberal member for Lyons and was also elected president of the Parliamentarians for Diabetes Global Network in Vancouver.

Fibre diet offers hope for diabetes 
A MEDICINAL diet that boosts good bacteria in the gut may be the key to reducing the risk of type-1 diabetes, one of the most common chronic diseases in children.
For the first time, Monash University-led research has shown a special combination of fibre - which could be taken as a powder sprinkled on food - can stop mice developing diabetes.
Plans are now under way to trial the fermentable fibres that promote gut health in humans with the hope of preventing the auto-immune disease from developing or reducing reliance on medication.
The diet, developed by CSIRO and refined by the university, uses a combination of resistant starches that are broken down by gut bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids - acetate and butyrate.
These beneficial substances, know as metabolites, are emerging as a key part of keeping the immune system healthy.
""We think that metabolites have anti-inflammatory effects and they do remarkable things in every single major disease we look at - cardiovascular disease, food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma,"" the university's Professor Charles Mackay said.

In a world first, Perth people with diabetes will have their eyes tested by GPs rather than having to go to a specialist.

 YOU may be surprised to know that more than 100,000 Australians developed diabetes in 2012. It's a serious, chronic illness that requires lifelong management.
As a GP, I see a lot of people with diabetes. With so many Australians at risk of developing the disease, it is important to understand what it is and how to avoid it.
For our bodies to work properly, we need to convert glucose (sugar) from food into energy. After you eat, your blood glucose levels increase and your body needs to store the glucose.
Insulin clears your blood of glucose and stores it for future use. With diabetes, the pancreas either can't make insulin (type 1), the body's cells don't properly respond to it or the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin (type 2).
High blood-glucose levels cause a number of health problems and complications, including: kidney damage; heart disease, strokes and circulation problems; eye damage; nerve damage; sexual difficulties, including erectile dysfunction; foot ulcers and infections.
The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is not yet known, but we do know it has a strong family link and cannot be prevented. You can develop type 1 as a child or in adulthood.
However, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be reduced through a healthy lifestyle.
Without lifestyle changes, in particular healthy eating, regular exercise, weight loss and quitting smoking, about one in three people with pre-diabetes (a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal) will develop type 2 diabetes.
A patient of mine, Elizabeth, was one of those people who adopted a healthy lifestyle and managed to avoid developing diabetes.
Elizabeth was in her late 50s, had recently retired, drove her car everywhere (never walked), added salt to all her meals, and regularly drank soft drink and two glasses of wine every night. She was overweight and her blood glucose levels were high - she was pre-diabetic, on the border of developing the disease.
Elizabeth was determined to improve her health and so began going for walks every morning. She has significantly cut her alcohol consumption (drinking one glass, three nights a week), opted for lean meat and fish, vegetables and salads and stopped pouring salt on to all her meals. She included fruit for dessert on some nights, instead of ice cream.
These changes have been fundamental to Elizabeth's health. She has lost weight, is fitter and her glucose levels are under control. She has significantly lowered her risk of developing diabetes.
However, I want to stress that diabetes is a manageable disease. Many patients with diabetes continue to lead full and happy lives - it's just they attend more doctor's appointments than their peers and they need to take medication every day.
Complications may arise, and they sometimes have to say no to a second serving of birthday cake. Simply, you don't want diabetes and so you should do everything you can to reduce your chances of developing it.
I encourage everyone to make healthy choices - exercise and eat well, and if you're a smoker, please stop for your own sake and your loved ones.
Do it now, because once you develop type 2 diabetes you've got it for life. Talk to your GP about how to improve your health and have your glucose levels checked. Dr Tony Bartone is a GP from Melbourne's northern suburbs.

MANGOES THE NEW FRESH SUPERFOOD
THE newest superfood is a Queensland icon, with fresh research suggesting mangoes may help combat type 2 diabetes. The study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, backed previous research which highlighted the tropical fruit's cancer-fighting capabilities.
Australian Mango Industry Association chief Robert Gray said he was heartened by the early animal study findings from Oklahoma State University scientists that showed a diet which included mango may boost gut health. Certain bacteria in the intestinal tract is believed to play a role in obesity and related health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes. The research was partly supported by the US National Mango Board.
""We are excited that the nutritional benefits of the mango are under the spotlight, and while this latest research has not yet been carried out on humans, findings are very promising,"" Mr Gray said. Queensland produced just over 50 per cent of the mangoes grown in Australia last year. One cup of diced mango provides 100 per cent of the daily requirement of vitamin C, 35 per cent of vitamin A and 20 per cent of folate.

Diabetes refocus
THE head of the Prime Minister's national diabetes advisory group has called for a greater focus on gestational diabetes, saying the condition is putting both mothers and children at a greater risk in the future.
Professor Paul Zimmet, co-chair of the expert group, said health experts needed to start as early as pregnancy if they were to lower the rate of diabetes in Australia in the future.
The advisory group is working on a national strategy to tackle the nation's diabetes epidemic, to be handed to the Federal Government this year.
""The children of mothers with gestational diabetes are more likely to develop diabetes themselves and this needs to be tackled quite strongly in any new national strategy,"" Professor Zimmet, director of the International Diabetes Institute, said. Professor Zimmet said poor diet and obesity during pregnancy increased the risk of gestational diabetes, as did family history.

Doctors crucify funding review - Bean counters dare to cut diabetes drugs
DIABETES patients, doctors and drug companies are in revolt over a Federal Government review of Type 2 treatments they fear will strip them of access to some tools and medicines.
More than 1.5 million Australians have diabetes and it is poised to become the number one disease burden nationally in the next five years.
The government is examining ways to control the $600 million a year it spends on products to help combat the problem.
Already an expert government committee has found taxpayers could save $50 million a year if it stopped supplying blood glucose strips to Type 2 diabetes patients who don't use insulin.
Another review is looking at who gets access to insulin pumps while a third review is examining the use of Type 2 diabetes medicines.
News Limited has obtained a letter signed by 18 medico, research, consumer and pharmaceutical groups that expresses ""serious concern"" the reviews will focus only on cost-effective use of medicines.
""Ultimately, if the Diabetes Review serves only to cut expenditure on diabetes treatment it will have failed to deliver on its potential to advance the clinical management of diabetes,"" the letter says.
At the heart of their concerns is their claim that current guidelines about diabetes treatment are not up to date.
Bizarrely, the group also complains about the government's price disclosure process which ensures the government pays the market price for drugs.
This process has generated around $1.3 billion in savings that can be used to fund new medicines and cut the amount general patients pay for drugs.
""We need a new treatment algorithm. We are falling behind because there are more medicines available in other countries,"" Diabetes Australia chief Greg Johnson said.
A government review has found a large proportion of the prescriptions supplied through the medicine subsidy scheme for a new class of diabetes medicines called gliptins ""do not meet the criteria for PBS subsidy"".
Three other diabetes medicines are also being given to patients outside the rules of the subsidy scheme and this could provide scope for the government to tighten access.
""As gliptins are much more costly than sulfonylureas, use outside of the current PBS restrictions is unlikely to be cost effective at the current prices,"" the government review found.
But Diabetes Australia says patients need individualised treatment plans that include new medicines as their diabetes progresses rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Ageing said post-market reviews of medicines are conducted through an established and transparent process, which includes open public consultation.
""The letter that is referred to in the question will be considered in the review as part of the stakeholder consultation process,"" she said.

Gabrielle's team
I t was a diagnosis teenager Gabrielle Lane and her family never expected. After weeks of illness and unexplained weight loss, the then-14-year-old was told she had type 1 diabetes - a disease she would need to manage for the rest of her life.
""When I was first diagnosed, I was very lost,"" Gabrielle says.
""If someone could have said these words to me, it would have made it whole lot easier: you are still a normal person, you aren't missing out on anything.""
Gabrielle, now 16, needs insulin injections several times a day via a pump and must constantly check her blood-glucose levels.
But she's taken the disease in her stride and is leading a team - The Jellybeans - in the HBF Run for a Reason to raise funds and awareness about diabetes. The Jellybeans have already hit their fundraising target of $500 for Diabetes WA and are still going. Diabetes WA is one of the official charity partners of this year's HBF Run for a Reason.
""I honestly feel as though diabetes can make a positive impact on my life,"" Gabrielle says.
""I will probably be a very healthy person in the future as I am constantly keeping track of what food I have eaten and what exercise I have done during the day.
""The main reason I'm running in the HBF Run for a Reason and fundraising for Diabetes WA is to give back to the people who have helped me get through the learning curve I have experienced.""

Gabrielle is one of about 1000 young people in WA living with type 1 diabetes. The condition occurs when the pancreas does not produce insulin because the cells which make this protein hormone have been destroyed by the immune system. To overcome it, daily insulin injections are required.

Adelaide company heads to the clinic
ADELAIDE medical technology company LBT Innovations has entered into an agreement for the use of its WoundVue prototype device in a clinical trial.
The trial, overseen by the Central Adelaide Local Health Network, is focused on predicting outcomes in patients with diabetic foot ulcers and the effectiveness of interventions to improve outcomes.
WoundVue is a handheld portable device that takes 2D and 3D images of chronic wounds to objectively monitor wound healing.
Professor Rob Fitridge, head of vascular surgery at CALHN and Lyell McEwin Hospital, said WoundVue would ""provide us with reliable and objective data that will feed into our predictive model for amputations resulting from diabetic foot ulcers"".
He believes there is ""a real clinical unmet need"" that WoundVue can address. The technology behind WoundVue originates from LBT's FDA-cleared APAS platform, where the core machine-learning algorithms have been adapted to interpret tissue types and automatically provide surface area, volume and depth measurements.
LBT boss Brent Barnes said the collaboration was the ""logical next step having recently completed the proof-of-principle work"".

High toll of illness
The condition is a shock to the body - and to the wallet, reports PETA RASDIEN
It can take decades to be realised but diabetes comes with a huge personal cost in terms of the many complications that can accrue, limiting the quality and length of lives.
In the just-launched second edition of his book Understanding Type 2 Diabetes, Merlin Thomas acknowledges that a diabetes diagnosis and its subsequent management could feel like a kind of curse: a Sisyphean penance brought on by excesses of the past.
Just like Sisyphus, who, as the Greek myth goes, was punished by Zeus for hubris and bad behaviour and forced to spend eternity pushing a boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down again before he reached the top, diabetics could feel like they had to endure a type of punishment to make up for poor lifestyle choices of the past.
But Professor Thomas, head of biochemistry of diabetes complications at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, said efforts to manage diabetes were never futile and could become effortless with practice.
Diagnosis could be the catalyst for a sea change in an individual's approach to life, diet and physical activity that would have benefits in the long term and help ward off the serious complications associated with the condition.
It was only through good management that people could reduce their risk of ""metabolic karma"" coming back to bite down the track.
Blood-sugar levels which regularly fall outside the target range leads to damage in large and small blood vessels and cause complications including heart attack, stroke and circulation problems in the lower limbs, as well as problems with eyes, feet, kidneys and nerves.
From your hair, which can turn prematurely grey, to the tips of your toes, which can become ulcerated, and everywhere in between, diabetes complications can affect every aspect of your body, according to Professor Thomas.
For men, a common complication is erectile dysfunction but others including cardiovascular disease, and stroke can be life-limiting, which should make compliance with an individualised diabetes management plan a high priority.
Apart from the physical, a diabetes diagnosis also takes an emotional toll - 21-36 per cent of adults with diabetes experience moderate to severe depression symptoms - and comes with a side serve of stigma that is hard to swallow for the two in three adults with diabetes who feel judged by others.
Professor Thomas said while it was never too late to make positive changes, for type 2 diabetics there was a window of opportunity in the first 10 years after diagnosis in which patients had the best chance to ""wake-up"" an under-performing pancreas and possibly even put the condition into remission.
This could be achieved through obesity surgery or a dedicated approach to diet and physical activity.
In reality, though, most people will need some form of medication to manage their sugar levels.
Two million Australians with diabetes are on some form of medication and on average will take 13 pills a day from about seven different classes of drugs.
The Diabetes MILES 2 report released last year revealed just 25 per cent of adults with diabetes who responded to a national survey had followed a healthful eating plan on all of the previous seven days and only 17 per cent had participated in at least 30 minutes of exercise on all seven days.
Professor Thomas said diabetes was the biggest health epidemic to face humans, with the number of people with diabetes in Australia three times higher than 25 years ago.
Two million Australians with diabetes are on some form of medication and on average will take 13 pills a day from about seven different classes of drugs.

Neil takes a shot at ending injections
NEIL Burton considers himself lucky - diagnosed at 11 with type 1 diabetes, he has had a kidney transplant in 2004, quintuple heart bypass last December, and a very special transplant this month.
The procedure at the Royal Adelaide Hospital makes him the first person in Australia to receive donor islets after a kidney transplant.
""I've been a diabetic for 43 years and have not had good control of it. I lost a lot of sight and by 2004 needed a kidney transplant,"" he said.
His hypoglycaemic episodes from diabetes initially made him a possible candidate for an islet transplant but he was not allowed on the list due to the kidney transplant.
That later changed and in October last year he started various tests to check his suitability - a heart stress test revealed problems which led to a quintuple bypass at the RAH in December.
""I'm fit, don't drink or smoke. I thought something must have been wrong with the machine,"" he said.
Further tests showed he recovered well enough to be back on the list. The transplants aim to control the ""hypo"" episodes, and Mr Burton, 53, will continue to take insulin while being monitored over the next few weeks.
As well as controlling the hypoglycaemic episodes, the islets will hopefully produce enough insulin so that Mr Burton will no longer need to take the injections he has lived with every day for more than four decades.
He is heading back to Barmera with wife Rebecca and sons Sam, 18 and Murray 17, this weekend, grateful for all he has. ""People like Professor Toby Coates and his team are just incredible people. I am a very lucky man,"" he said.

Cutting down on certain foods can do wonders

""A reduction in 140 calories per day for one year will result in 7kg of weight loss,"" she said.
""If you reduce your intake of discretionary food, that's not hard to achieve - it is one less row of chocolate, or one less beer or soft drink per day.
""It is never too late to make changes to your eating or physical activity. Obviously, the earlier in life this occurs the better, but changes to weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose levels are beneficial at any age.

Diabetic drug hits heart of problem
DIABETES will no longer be a death sentence for many people with a drug commonly prescribed to reduce blood sugar levels found to significantly reduce heart problems - the biggest killer of diabetics.
Australian doctors have been given the green light to prescribe Jardiance to Type-2 diabetics with cardiovascular issues, with the change being hailed as a significant advance in the battle against the scourge of diabetes.
About 80 per cent of diabetics die from cardiovascular complications such as a heart attack.
Current medications lower blood sugar, which can prevent complications such as blindness and kidney damage, but do nothing for heart health.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has listed Jardiance to reduce cardiovascular deaths in diabetics - the first drug to offer that benefit.
Cardiologist Professor Andrew Sindone hailed the listing as a ""big advance"", given a third of his patients have diabetes.
""It's a big epidemic and this change will have a big impact on those people's health,"" the Sydney professor said.
The discovery was made while the drug was being safety tested, with researchers finding it reduced the risk of a diabetic dying from cardiovascular disease by 38 per cent. It also reduced heart failure hospitalisation risk by 35 per cent.
""We've never had anything like that before so this is pretty exciting,"" Prof Sindone said, adding that it will revolutionise the management of diabetes.
Prof Sindone said patients on the drug passed about 18 sugar cubes worth of glucose through their urine every day and dropped about 5kg in weight in three months.
After rigorous scrutiny of the study, which was published in 2015, Australian authorities have approved the drug for use in cardiac health.
""This is our big chance to help people with diabetes,"" Prof Sindone said. Endocrinologist Associate Professor Roger Chen expects the drug will be prescribed to more diabetics and save lives. ""The results were incredible,"" he said.

$100k payout is ice on the cake for drug dealer
A SERIAL methamphetamine trafficker has won a $100,000 payout from taxpayers after claiming his diabetes worsened because he was fed prison food and his condition was not properly managed behind bars.
The out-of-court settlement to recidivist drug trafficker Bruno Tassone comes just a fortnight after the Government launched its offensive against the deadly drug, ice - a special taskforce to respond to the growing use of the drug in the community.
Tassone's payout - a commercial decision made by the Crown Solicitor's Office - will be placed in the Prisoner Compensation Quarantine Fund for 12 months to allow any victims of his crimes to make a claim against it.
Correctional Services and Police Minister Peter Malinauskas last night urged anyone who may have been a victim of Tassone's crimes to claim against his award.
""This is a decision that hasn't been made by the department or me as minister, but rather by the appropriate authorities in Crown,"" he said.
""What I think is important is that we have in place a legislative regime that ensures victims' interests are put ahead of the offender. That process is now under way and there is a mechanism for victims of the offenders' crimes to be able to get access to these funds before he ever does."" Of the $100,000 settlement, Tassone's lawyers will receive $40,163.43, he will receive $49,836.57 and $10,000 is for medical expenses.
Commissioner for Victims' Rights Michael O'Connell said many people would be ""appalled"" that a convicted drug offender had received such a large payout, but if ""he was wronged while in prison, he is entitled like any other victim to apply for compensation"".
""If any victim of his crime believes they might have a claim for harm Bruno Tassone caused them, they should explore their right to restitution now, while he has money to pay,"" Mr O'Connell said.
He said Tassone should be treated like any law-abiding citizen who receives welfare and the payment should be counted against any income he has and put towards the $96,000 annual cost of keeping him in prison. ""For example, if Mr Tassone was paid $100,000, should he not now pay for his medical and other treatment costs during his prison term and thereafter, rather than the taxpayer pay?"" he said. Tassone, 61, who has a significant record for drug trafficking offences involving cannabis, cocaine and methamphetamines and is in custody until 2020, launched his claim against the state and the Central Adelaide Local Health Network - which operates the prison medical service - in January, 2011.
In his District Court statement of claim, he alleged when he was incarcerated between 2007 and 2010, he was not given the appropriate diet for a diabetic and was denied treatment for his condition. As a result, the sight in his right eye deteriorated significantly. He has been legally blind in his left eye since childhood.
He was serving six years and nine months, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months, at the time of his alleged mistreatment, after being convicted of possession of methamphetamines and cocaine. Tassone's statement of claim alleges he did not receive meals ""appropriate"" for his condition, he was not allowed to exercise appropriately for his condition and authorities ignored or failed to take adequate action after he reported that his health was deteriorating. He also alleged the prison health service had no appropriately trained nurse to treat diabetic patients, it did not conduct adequate blood sugar tests and/or urine tests and ""ignored or refused"" a urine test request that he had offered to pay for himself.
In its filed defence, the state denied liability and alleged Tassone's medical records revealed he had a long history of elevated blood sugar levels dating back as early as January, 2002. The records also noted that on November 7, 2007 - almost a month before he was incarcerated - Tassone ""had not checked his BSL at home, his bloods were last done three months ago and he had poor control (referring to his diabetes)."" ""While incarcerated between about December 2007 and 2010, the plaintiff decided to consume meals and snacks (in addition to his supplied diabetic meals) that were inappropriate for his diabetic condition."" Tassone has been convicted numerous times of drug trafficking and possessing commercial quantities of drugs, with convictions dating back to 1992 in the NT.
In 2004 in SA, he was convicted of possessing cannabis for supply and was given an 18-month suspended sentence.
In June last year, Tassone was again convicted of trafficking in methamphetamines and fantasy that followed a raid on his western suburbs home - while he was still on parole for his previous offending. Besides the fantasy, which had a street value of up to $9200 and the methamphetamine, which had a value of up to $11,000, police found electronic scales and small bags in his bedroom. In sentencing Tassone to six years and six months jail with a three-year and six months non-parole period, District Judge Sophie David said illicit drugs ""have a terrible impact on our community"". Tassone appealed his conviction to the Full Court of the Supreme Court, but it was dismissed last December.

Whey, the liquid material created as a by-product of cheese production - and famously eaten by Little Miss Muffet in the nursery rhyme - could help combat Australia's fastest-growing chronic disease, type 2 diabetes.
Curtin University researchers have found evidence that the protein fragments derived from milk can help regulate insulin production in those with the chronic illness, affecting about one million Australians.
Project leader Philip Newsholme, of Curtin's school of biomedical sciences, said the research showed whey could play a significant role in stabilising blood glucose levels in diabetes patients.
""In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas makes insulin but it's not produced in the amount your body needs and it does not work effectively,"" Professor Newsholme said. ""Our study demonstrates how consumption of whey - a highly digestible source of protein found in many dairy products - impacts positively on the pancreatic cells, helping them to release more insulin. This in turn helps to regulate blood glucose levels and could aid in the management of type 2 diabetes.""
The findings, featured in the July issue of the Journal of Nutrition, involved cellular tests and an eight-week study in mice. The research was carried out with the University College of Dublin, the University of Limerick and the Cork-based Teagasc Food Research Centre.
Professor Newsholme said studies in people with diabetes were needed to confirm the results but the initial findings were promising that milk, or milk-derived products, could become key in managing type 2 diabetes.
The total annual cost of treating type 2 diabetes in Australians is up to $6 billion, reports Diabetes Australia.

Research has revealed that Ms Kordyban is part of a large group of Australians who are unaware of the risk of diabetes.
Findings from the Amcal Consumer Health Barometer to be released today show 39 per cent of people with a family history of any serious illness refused to be tested, a significant number of them because they feared the results. But Australians are particularly unaware of gestational diabetes, with 50 per cent admitting they had never heard of the disease subtype, even though up to 8 per cent of pregnancies are affected.
About one in 10 incorrectly assumed you must be overweight or obese to develop the condition.

""I think the diet was the most annoying bit. You think it's a free pass when you're pregnant and you can eat whatever you want but I can't,"" she said.

How new parks can fix health problems
YOU are what you eat, and you are where you live, too. And for the people of Western Sydney that is becoming a serious problem.
New research shows type-2 diabetes clusters in hot spots around suburbs in the west that are short on parks.
University of Western Sydney researcher Dr Thomas Astell-Burt's work found these ""health food deserts"", where people eat unhealthy foods and have no place to work it off, were a recipe for bad health.
""We have stark inequalities between east and west,"" Dr Astell-Burt said. ""The risk of having diabetes is significantly higher in places like Blacktown and Mount Druitt in comparison to the more affluent east and north shore.
""If you have small pockets of space it's great to push a pram but not great for working up a sweat and playing with a football. They seem to be rarer in Western Sydney."" The findings are part of a push to create healthier suburbs by reshaping the physical environment with parks, walking and cycling tracks and town planning limiting fast food outlets.
Western Sydney Nutrition and Dietetics dietitian Samantha Rand said unhealthy food choices increased the risk of diabetes.
""Carbohydrates are cheap so the fast food outlets pump their food full of carbs,"" she said.
Ms Rand said healthy, culturally appealing fast food was needed outside of the kebab stores, bakeries and pizza shops that dominate in the western suburbs.
TAFE Western Sydney has partnered with Foodbank, which takes surplus food from industry to charities, to provide meals cooked by students at their training restaurants.
Blacktown councillor Jacqueline Donaldson said funding was needed for larger parks, which encouraged exercise and sport.
""We do want to have some mega-parks where there's lots of interactive equipment,"" Ms Donaldson said. She also said education for children was vital to change unhealthy eating habits they adopt from their parents, as well as for adults - many of whom didn't even know they had diabetes.

Greater health woes tipped from pathology cuts
Diabetics could be out of pocket hundreds of dollars each year for their treatment if cuts to pathology go ahead, raising the risk of complications including kidney disease, doctors warn.
Health Minister Sussan Ley last month flagged plans to cut and limit bulk billing incentive payments for pathology and diagnostic imaging services, saving the government $650 million over four years.
Dr Nick Musgrave, president of Pathology Australia, said that without the payment, most pathology services would no longer be bulk-billed. Major pathology providers have already indicated they will pass losses from the cuts on to patients.
About 1.7 million Australians with diabetes, he said, could have to pay more than $400 upfront for a year of standard blood and urine tests to monitor their kidneys and risk of heart disease. Higher costs could deter some patients from doing the tests ""making management of their diabetes more difficult for their doctors, and will result in an increase in complications of diabetes including kidney disease and blindness,"" Dr Musgrave said.
This follows reports that the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia said pap smears could cost women at least $30 upfront if the cuts go ahead. Ms Ley's spokesman last week said that the government was not changing the Medicare rebate for pap smears but removing an ""inefficient payment"" to pathology firms. Patients would be ""rightly suspicious"" of providers claiming they will raise costs to make up losses, he said.
Dr Musgrave said that even with the rebate, patients with diabetes would still be about $270 out of pocket a year, as the Medicare rebate for pathology services had been frozen for the past 20 years: ""It doesn't matter how the government would like to construct the funding of the tests, [the bulk-billing incentive is] part of the overall funding for them.""
Diabetes educator and nurse Cheryl Steele said that type 2 diabetes patients over 50 years, including pensioners, were most likely to forego pathology tests, risking kidney and cardiovascular diseases, because they were often already paying for multiple medications. Those from non-English and lower socioeconomic backgrounds were particularly vulnerable because they had a lower understanding of how to manage their diabetes.
""We have patients who will take medication for blood pressure this month and cholesterol next month because they can't afford it all,"" Ms Steele, a director of the Australian Diabetes Educators Association, said. ""Anything that puts extra burden on them to maintain good health will ultimately end up costing more hospital beds.""
Dr Musgrave said that higher pathology fees could also deter patients from getting tested for conditions that did not display obvious initial symptoms, including cervical, bowel and prostate cancers and Hepatitis C: ""If there's a delay in diagnosis... because of the co-payment they will have a far worse clinical outcome and it's possible that by the time of diagnosis, the disease is incurable.""
Health Minister Sussan Ley's spokesman said the Medicare rebate for pathology tests remained the same, and the tests were still covered by the Medicare Safety Net. He called pathologists' warnings ""opportunistic"", saying it ""shows this debate is really about protecting profits, not patients"".

Moderate drinking may lower risk of diabetes 
Drinking moderately three or four times a week may protect people against diabetes.
A study has found that men who drank 14 units a week, equivalent to 1 1/2 bottles of wine, and women who drank nine units lowered their chance of contracting type II diabetes by 43 per cent and 58 per cent respectively.
Scientists cautioned that the research should not be taken as advice to drink - the Danish study looked only at diabetes and did not take into consideration other known problems linked to alcohol.
Janne Tolstrup, of the University of Southern Denmark, said she conducted the research because of previous studies showing an apparent connection between drinking and diabetes. She wanted to see whether the pattern of drinking as well as absolute quantities played a role.
""I've done a lot of research into the association between alcohol drinking patterns and the risk of coronary heart disease,"" she said. ""It is very evident that if you compare two men drinking the same amount, the risk depends on how they spread it out."" She wanted to see whether the same applied to diabetes.
Her research involved looking at the health records of more than 70,000 Danes and following them for five years. As well as the link between quantity of alcohol and diabetes, she found spreading that drink over three to four days presented the lowest risk.
Quite why either result would be the case is not clear, although some studies have suggested a link between alcohol and insulin persistence.
Professor Tolstrup said while the findings, published in the journal Diabetologia, were interesting, people should be wary of using them in day-to-day lives.

Screen diabetics for loss of vision
DIABETICS should be screened as part of a national program to prevent thousands of Australians going blind.
More than 10,000 Australians have lost their vision in the past decade as a result of the disease, but another 300,000 have diabetic retinopathy, which makes it hard to read or watch TV. Eye experts say many of these cases could be avoided if diabetics underwent regular screening.
Professor Peter Scanlon, who set up a screening program in the UK in 2003 and is in Australia to share his knowledge, said it was the most common cause of blindness in the working age population.
Diabetic retinopathy damages blood vessels inside the retina, which can cause vision loss and blindness.
Prof Scanlon said Australia needed to do something to catch the disease at an earlier stage.
""If you wait until people have lost vision, it's usually quite an advanced stage and more difficult to treat and people are more likely to have a permanent loss of vision.
""I think you can prevent up to 90 per cent of cases through early detection and intervention,"" he said.
This may include better control of the individual's blood sugar levels, medication or laser surgery. Centre for Eye Research Australia (CERA) principal investigator and ophthalmologist Dr Peter van Wijngaarden said diabetics can get biannual eye checks through Medicare, but only half of them do. CERA, Diabetes Australia and Baker IDI are leading the charge for a national screening program.

Full-fat dairy may reduce type 2 diabetes
EATING full fat yoghurt and cheese may help reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes.
Researchers at Lund University in Sweden found consumption of high-fat yoghurt and cheese reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by as much as 20 per cent, however, high meat consumption on the other hand, increased the risk.
The findings, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, are in line with previous studies of eating habits that indicated a link between high consumption of dairy products and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.
""Those who ate the most high-fat dairy products had a 23 per cent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who ate the least. High meat consumption was linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes regardless of the fat content of the meat,"" lead researcher Ulrika Ericson said.
The study looked at the eating habits of 27,000 individuals aged 45 to 74 over a 20-year period as part of the Malm? Diet and Cancer study of the 1990s. Two decades on 10 per cent or 2860 people had developed type 2 diabetes.
The aim of the study has been to investigate the significance of saturated fat in food and its role in developing type 2 diabetes.
Instead of focusing on the total intake of saturated fat, the researchers looked at different sources of saturated fat. ""Our results suggest that we should not focus solely on fat, but rather consider what foods we eat,"" the researchers found.

One-step diabetes drug now on PBS
THOUSANDS of Australians with type 2 diabetes will next month be able to have one injection a week instead of 14 and save $1600 a year under a new Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing.
Health Minister Sussan Ley will announce today that new diabetes treatment exanatide, sold as Bydureon, will be listed on the taxpayer-funded PBS, improving the lives of up to 20,000 Australians.
Four other diabetes drugs that lower blood sugar levels are among those being added to the list on September 1.
The $70 million announcement of new medicines on the PBS will also include breakthrough treatments for cervical cancer and other illnesses.
The new diabetes drugs are expected to be cost-neutral because they provide alternatives to existing treatments.
""As one of our most prominent chronic diseases, type 2 diabetes is placing a significant cost on the nation's health and finances at nearly $1 billion per year,"" Ms Ley said.
""According to Diabetes Australia, there were about 4000 amputations last year that could have avoided with better daily management of a patient's condition. Our hospitals also saw over 900,000 diabetes-related admissions.
""Subsidising innovative medicines like these that make it easier for thousands of patients to keep on top of their diabetes and better manage their medication, not only save them time and money, but also save the health system.""

'Quick fix' surgery urged for diabetics 
Weight-loss surgery should be a standard treatment for people with type 2 diabetes, a coalition of international experts have announced in a radical departure from the conventional approach to tackling the disease pandemic.
The guidelines, published on Wednesday and hailed as the biggest change to the treatment of the disease in almost a century, could result in more type 2 patients going under the knife to curb their weight gain and control their blood sugar levels.
Critics have argued surgical options - which bind or remove a portion of the stomach or intestines - could be seen by patients as a quick fix, and derail efforts to encourage lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, to manage the condition.
The joint statement endorsed by 45 medical and scientific groups, including Australian experts, recommends surgery as standard treatment for obese type 2 diabetes patients - with a BMI over 35 - who can't control their blood sugar levels through other means.
""These patients should be told that they are not just eligible but recommended for this surgery. Caring doctors should tell them,"" said physician and diabetes researcher John Dixon at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute.
""It's the responsibility now for health services to include this as standard therapy for these patients,"" Professor Dixon said.
While, type 2 diabetes is most prevalent among lower socioeconomic groups, the surgery costs upwards of $9000 and is almost exclusively offered in private hospitals.
By 2030, the number of people with diabetes worldwide is expected to rise to 472 million.
An estimated 1.2 million Australians have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - the vast majority of whom are overweight or obese. Medicare currently covers gastric bypass surgery and laparoscopic banding surgery for conditions related to morbid obesity.
""We've got to shake up our public hospital system in each state and remove the barriers that are preventing people for getting this treatment,"" Professor Dixon said.
""This is the greatest departure from mainstream treatments of diabetes perhaps since insulin was introduced,"" wrote Professor Francesco Rubino, chair of metabolic and bariatric surgery at King's College London, in the journal Nature.

Solids link to risk of diabetes 
INTRODUCING solids to a baby's diet too soon or too late could increase their risk of developing type 1 diabetes, new research shows.
The US researchers said incidence of the disease was increasing around the world, and most rapidly among children aged under five.
""The increased risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus found with early (less than 4 months) and late (equal or greater than 6 months) introduction of solid foods appears to be driven by late first exposure to rice/oat and early first exposure to wheat/barley and fruit,"" the study, published today in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, says.
Australian feeding guidelines recommend infants be exclusively breastfed until around six months of age when solids are introduced.
Modbury mother-of-two Danielle Steinbeck began introducing solids for her daughter Kaley, who turns two next month, when she was about six months.
""We chose then because of the guidelines and because we had moved her on to the bottle at about 5 1/2 months and we didn't want to change too much too quickly,"" she said.

Surgery effective against diabetes
STOMACH stapling, lap bands and other bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective treatment for type 2 diabetes in obese patients.
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine followed 150 patients with type 2 diabetes. One third was offered intensive medical therapy only, while the other two thirds underwent either gastric bypass surgery or gastroectomy (partial removal of the stomach). Nine out of 10 of the patients who underwent bariatric surgery achieved a 25	 per cent reduction in body weight and controlled their diabetes three years after surgery without the use of insulin and other medication.
Obesity has overtaken smoking as the leading cause of premature death in Australia, with 14 million people overweight and 900,000 thought to suffer either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, at an estimated cost of $8.3 billion.
There is no cure for type 2 diabetes, but 60 per cent of cases can be prevented by following a healthy lifestyle and maintaining a healthy weight. Dr Ahmed Aly, a gastrointestinal surgeon from the Austin Hospital in Melbourne, said the study suggested that bariatric surgery should be considered earlier than its current uptake, which tended to be a last resort.

Misbehaving cells caught at diabetes crime scene
Researchers have for the first time observed immune cells in the pancreas of a type 1 diabetes patient, allowing them to watch as the cells attack and destroy the body's insulin-producing molecules.
Dr Stuart Mannering, an immunologist at St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, said the breakthrough was like catching the misbehaving immune cells at the scene of the crime.
The body's immune cells are not meant to attack the islet cells, which produce the insulin needed to regulate blood-sugar levels.
In type 1 diabetes patients, the islet cells, found in the pancreas, are mistakenly attacked by immune cells. Because the body cannot produce enough insulin, patients then have to administer insulin injections and carefully monitor their blood-sugar levels.
The breakthrough by a team led by Dr Mannering was made possible through the donation of a pancreas from a 19-year-old Tasmanian man, who died from complications of the disease six years ago.
""It's extremely rare to get that sort of opportunity,"" Dr Mannering said. ""It's really given us an unprecedented insight.""
After receiving the pancreas, the researchers set about isolating the islet cells and then placed them in culture with growth factors. About a week later, islet and immune cells known as T-cells were present.
""Some of the islet cells had a halo of immune cells surrounding them. It looked like they had all come charging out of the islet cells and formed a big circle around what was left of the islet,"" Dr Mannering said. ""It was quite remarkable.""
Published on Tuesday in the journal Diabetes, the findings are expected to change the design of clinical trials.
Understanding how the interaction between the immune and islet cells works is a key not only to understanding the disease but also to better designing medications to treat the condition.
By watching the two types of cells interacting at the microscopic level, the researchers also established the immune cells were targeting a specific part of the islet cells, called the C-peptide.
""Now, we know who to target and what they recognise, so we can try and work out how to stop that process,"" Dr Mannering said.
St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research director Tom Kay, a co-author of the paper, said the findings were a landmark in the understanding of the mechanisms at play in the disease. He said establishing the role C-peptide played in the process was also important for future drug development. ""That part of insulin is not in the insulin that companies make and put in a bottle and sell,"" he said.
According to Diabetes Australia, more than 130,000 Australians live with type 1 diabetes. There is currently no cure.
Type 1 diabetes
What the witnesses saw
Insulin-secreting cells live in the pancreas in little islands of cells called islets.
In type-1 diabetes the body's immune system infiltrates the islets and mistakenly destroys insulin-secreting cells.

Scientists isolated an islet and were able to see immune cells attacking it - and specifically the C-peptide.

Transplant gives fab four new lease of life
FOUR Australian women who had pancreas cell transplants to stop the symptoms of type 1 diabetes want more sufferers to have the procedure that transformed their lives.
The women and their husbands have united to raise money for the Islet Transplant Program at St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research.

12 limbs a day toll of diabetes 
EACH day 12 Australians with diabetes lose entire limbs and parts of their feet in largely preventable amputations.
Not only does the extreme surgery reduce the quality and length of patient's lives, it is also a significant burden on the health system.
At least 85 per cent of amputations are preventable, but it's not as simple as diabetics checking their own feet, with reduced nerve sensation making it difficult for them to detect ulcers.
Poor blood flow also means that for a diabetic, a stubbed toe or ulcer can quickly turn into a wound that doesn't heal and eventually requires an amputation, Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said. ""It's a staggering number: 4400 amputations every year in Australia and that's just the tip of the iceberg because there are also more than 10,000 admissions to hospitals for diabetic foot problems,"" he said.

""A sudden swollen foot revealed my diabetes; days later I was almost blind""
Susan Harvey, 65, thought her swollen foot was the result of an insect bite. When doctors gave her the correct diagnosis, her life was turned upside-down. She tells her story to Beverly Hadgraft ""My mum was in her 60s when she got diabetes.
I exercised regularly and rarely needed more than a pill for a headache, so I thought to myself, that will never happen to me.
I cared for Mum until she died, and I'd hit my 60s by the time I woke on Australia Day 2009 with my right foot as big as a balloon.
I couldn't walk on it, so I called a taxi and got myself to hospital.
I told the doctors I must have been bitten by something as they took blood tests and did X-rays.
But it turned out to be something much worse than that.
I had type 2 diabetes. The swelling in my foot was due to osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone. Osteomyelitis of the foot is apparently surprisingly common in diabetics. I had two broken toes and hadn't even realised because of the damage the diabetes had already caused to the nerves in my feet.
I was put on a very strong antibiotic drip and insulin. I felt quite stunned. However, there was worse to come.
While I was in hospital, I'd buy a newspaper every day. However, a few days into my treatment, I picked it up and couldn't see the print. It was just a grey blur.
""I can't read the paper!"" I said to the nurse and she told me not to worry, and that my vision would come back in about six weeks.
A doctor gave me the same reassurance and I now realise that, back then, people didn't realise that diabetes puts you at high risk of eye disease.
It wasn't until I'd left hospital and seen a diabetes specialist that I was sent to get my eyes checked. Finally the diagnosis was confirmed: I had an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy.
My high glucose levels had led to damage to the blood vessels in the back of my eye.
The treatment freaked me out.
I had to have needles in my eye every month. I also needed laser treatment in my right eye, then three lots of surgery to control the bleeding at the back of both eyes.
I had to have my right cataract done and my left one will also need treatment, as early cataracts are also common in diabetics.
The specialist eventually said that my eyes had been so badly damaged there was nothing he could do to restore my vision.
I live by myself in my Sydney home and was very frightened that I might go completely blind. The surgery was especially distressing.
It was around that time that I reached out to the Macular Disease Foundation Australia for help. They were so kind and helpful. I've ended up volunteering three days a week for them and I've found it a great comfort.
Fortunately, my sight has been preserved sufficiently that I can still read with my left eye with the aid of magnifying glasses.
I can also do my own shopping, although I have to bring things right up to my face to read the labels.
However, I've lost the ability to do simple pleasures such as knitting or sewing.
I'm still only 65. The diabetes is now under control but I so wish I'd gone for regular eye tests before this point. I thought my eyesight was fine so I hadn't visited an optometrist in years. I'm sure if I'd done so, they would've seen what was happening at the back of my eyes and perhaps diagnosed my condition earlier.
At least I can tell my story now and, hopefully, it will remind others to have an eye check at a minimum every two years, especially if they are or even think they could be diabetic.
I can't emphasise that enough.
Look at me - I'm paying dearly for what I didn't do.""
EYE FACTS Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and the leading cause of preventable blindness among working-age Aussies.
Almost 1.1 million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and more than 300,000 have a degree of diabetic retinopathy. Everyone with diabetes is at risk.
Because damage occurs before any changes to vision are noticed, it's essential to have an eye check at least every two years and every three to 12 months if eye disease has been diagnosed.
The longer you've had diabetes, the more important it is to keep getting regular checks, even if previous test results have been clear.
Treatment is effective if it's delivered early, and almost all vision loss is preventable.

Instinct saved my son from death by diabetes
MUM 'JUST KNEW' TOT WAS ILL DESPITE DOC'S ALL-CLEAR
KINGSTON Shooter owes his life to his mum's intuition. Natasha Elliott took her 10-month-old to a Mackay GP last year after she had trouble waking him, he had lost weight and was drinking and urinating more than usual.
When the GP told her ""there's nothing wrong with your baby"", the then 19-year-old decided to follow her maternal instincts and took him to the Mackay Hospital.
""I went into mumma mode,"" she said. ""I knew he was sick. I could feel it."" After specialists at Mackay Hospital found he had high blood sugar levels, a social worker told her the condition was serious and advised her to contact Kingston's dad, Michael Shooter, in case they needed to say a final goodbye to their son.
""Kingston had extreme dehydration. His organs were shutting down,"" she said. Kingston was flown to Townsville by the Royal Flying Doctor Service in a diabetic coma. He spent three days in the paediatric intensive care unit at Townsville Hospital where doctors diagnosed him with type 1 diabetes. Injections of insulin are the only way a person with the disease can survive. Unlike many patients with type 2 diabetes - rarely diagnosed in children aged under 10 - the condition cannot be treated by lifestyle modifications alone.
Paediatric endocrinologist Dr Tony Huynh said the overall rate of type 1 diabetes was rising, with significant increases in two to five-year-olds and in adolescents.
In 2012, Queensland had 93 children aged five and under with type 1 diabetes. Today, the figure is 151.
As Kingston emerged from his coma, his parents did everything they could to learn how to manage their son's illness.
""It was so hard giving him needles every day. It was seriously like torturing my child,"" Ms Elliott said.
But recently the Bribie Island Diabetes Support Group bought him an $8000 insulin pump which gives him smaller doses better suited to babies and toddlers.
Diabetes Queensland CEO Michelle Trute said the Federal Government was considering a proposal for a national diabetes strategy involving more effective subsidies for pumps and similar technology to assist patients.

Diabetes bill balloons by 86pc
An ageing population and obesity crisis have led to diabetes costs rising by 86 per cent over an eight-year period, posing a significant challenge to the long-term sustainability of the federal health budget.
A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) found expenditure for diabetes in Australia exceeded $1.5 billion in 2008-09, up from $811 million in 2000-01. That spending accounted for 2.3 per cent of expenditure for all diseases in 2008-09.
Evidence in more recent years suggests spending on the disease, which is split into juvenile Type 1 and lifestyle-related Type 2, has increased even further. According to Diabetes Australia, as many as 1.5 million Australians have some form of diabetes, including undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes.
Government expenditure on the National Diabetes Services Scheme, which pays for products and services related to diabetes such as blood sugar testing devices, increased by 123 per cent to nearly $182 million between 2002-03 and 2011-12.
The government is currently reviewing the scheme in an attempt to determine where cost-saving adjustments can be made.
According to the AIHW report, the largest share of spending in 2008-09 was for hospital-admitted patient services at $647 million, followed by blood glucose lowering medications and out-of-hospital medical expenses. Expenditure for Type 2 diabetes accounted for 60 per cent of the total.
In 2009 diabetes was the main cause of 3 per cent of all deaths and is a common contributor to kidney and heart disease.

Plastic poses a hazard
A COMPOUND found in plastic containers for food and drink could be causing obesity and diabetes, Victorian and French scientists warn.
Deakin University has discovered a new pathway for the chemical bisphenol A (BPA) to spread through the body.
Dr Yann Gibert, who carried out the research with the Institute of Functional Genomics of Lyon, in France, said it was time for Australia to introduce a ban or update safe consumption levels.
Dr Gibert said the link between BPA exposure and diabetes and obesity had been detected, but until now it was unclear how it worked.
""We have found the missing link. The BPA spreads through the body via a protein known as ERRy (oestrogen-related receptor), which is important in metabolism and metabolic disorders."" Previously it had been thought that BPA only binds to an oestrogen receptor and affects the hormone function.
But he said they found in vitro that BPA binds to and activates the ERRy receptor 1000 times more than with the oestrogen receptor, which means it has a more potent effect on metabolism.
Dr Gibert said current safe ingestion levels of 50 micrograms of BPA per day were based on the oestrogen receptor, so this new research should lead to changes to the guidelines.
He said even though there had been a voluntary move away from using BPA in Australia, other bisphenol compounds were now being used.
The Metabolic Research Unit will now undertake a world-first study into the metabolic effects of other types of these compounds during embryo formation and development.
Dr Gibert said unborn babies and infants were potentially the most at risk from BPA because adults have enzymes that protect their bodies from the effects.

Obesity, diabetes a strain on heart
THERE are fears Australia is heading backwards in the fight against heart disease, with a report warning an epidemic of ""diabesity"" risks fuelling a resurgence of the condition.
Research from Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, to be released today, will warn of an ""alarming increase"" in the number of Australians with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat).
The authors said this increase, coupled with the ""epidemic"" of obesity and type 2 diabetes - or ""diabesity"" - was threatening to undo five decades of work to reduce rates of heart disease.
Their report, commissioned by four Australian drug companies, predicted rates of atrial fibrillation, which increased the risk of stroke fivefold, would grow by 60 per cent over the next 15 years.
Baker IDI head of population health and report co-author Jonathan Shaw said as well as an ageing population, Australia faced being ""attacked from two ends"", as people with obesity and early onset type 2 diabetes also began developing premature cardiovascular disease.
But Australian Medical Association Queensland spokesman, cardiologist David Colquhoun, said there was ""no evidence"" of a resurgence of heart disease in the report, which he described as ""very disappointing"".
""They are torturing the data,"" he said.
Prof Colquhoun also described the report as ""vague"" and said it missed vital information, such as the emerging link between heart disease and depression.
Heart Foundation Queensland health director Rachelle Foreman said the report's suggestion that governments must act to prevent heart disease was sound.
""We certainly haven't beaten cardiovascular disease so, as the Baker IDI report alludes to, we do need better prevention."" Aspley mother-of-three Kristin Hansen, 32, was in the best shape of her life and training for a marathon when she received the shock diagnosis of a heart condition last year. ""People associate heart disease with old people and overweight people, but it's important to be aware of it and get regular check-ups even if you don't think there's anything wrong,"" she said.

Big health fears as more young people pile on the weight
Australians in their 20s and 30s are gaining weight at an alarming rate, increasing their risk of developing diabetes and heart disease, a study has found.
The trend has renewed calls for a debate on tougher interventions to tackle the obesity epidemic, such as a tax on junk foods and more subsidies for fruit and vegetables.
The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study of 11,000 adults over 12 years found that, on average, people between 25 and 34 stacked on 6.7 kilograms during the period - more than any other age group.
For those between 35 and 44, the average weight gain was 4.7kg, followed by 2.7kg for people 45 to 54 and 0.4kg for those aged 55 to 64.
While people over 65 lost an average of 2.1kg to 4.5kg over the 12 years, researcher and Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute associate director Jonathan Shaw said they were still expanding. The average waist circumference had increased between 0.8 centimetres and 2.7cm over the study period.
""What I think is happening here is that people are losing muscle mass, but still gaining fat, so the net result on their weight is stable or falling but the net result on their health is still negative because muscle is good for us and fat is bad for us,"" Associate Professor Shaw said.
People living in outer regional and remote areas were more likely to have gained weight during the period than their urban counterparts, and on average, the waist circumference increase was 50 per cent greater in women than in men.
At the beginning of the study, in 2000, 22 per cent of participants were obese. This had increased to 27 per cent by 2012. A report on the study to be released on Monday also shows:
About 269 people over 25 are developing diabetes every day.
The incidence of diabetes is five times higher among people who are obese and two times higher among the overweight.
People living in the most disadvantaged areas are twice as likely to develop diabetes compared with those in the most advantaged regions.
Having diabetes almost doubles the chance of needing to go to hospital and requiring multiple visits to a GP each year.
Professor Shaw said he was concerned that young people in their 20s and 30s were putting on so much weight and making themselves prone, in middle age, to develop obesity and its associated health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.
""It's in the 20s and 30s that the ground work is being laid,"" he said. ""That's the time when they can most easily turn this around.""
Professor Shaw said while it was up to individuals to eat well and to exercise, governments needed to do more to support people wanting to stay well or lose weight.

New hope pill can prevent loss of vision
A NEW use for an old cholesterol drug could prevent blindness in patients with Type 2 diabetes, which has affected ten thousand Australians in the past decade.
The nation's medicines regulator has approved the first tablet to help slow down diabetic retinopathy that can cause blindness.
The blood fat lowering pill Lipidil has been used for almost ten years in Australia to manage blood cholesterol but breakthrough Australian research has found it also helps slow down vision loss in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
Sydney University cardiologist Professor Tony Keech studied the effects of the cholesterol pill Lipidil on reducing heart disease in 10,000 patients with Type 2 diabetes between 1997 and 2005.
The research also tested evidence the medicine had an effect on the retina. ""We discovered that Lipidil had a major beneficial effect on eye disease and disability,"" he said. The need for laser surgery to prevent bleeding at the back of the eye was reduced by 37 per cent in patients using Lipidil, he said.
A later US study backed this finding.
In the last decade 20,000 Australians had their limbs amputated as a result of diabetes and the Australian study found a 36 per cent reduction in the need for this treatment in patients using Lipidil.
However, the medicine has not been approved for this use.
A million Australians have type 2 diabetes and around 300,000 of them have diabetic retinopathy that makes it difficult to read, watch TV or drive.
And studies show 60 per cent of people with Type 2 diabetes will develop eye disease within 20 years of their diagnosis. Patients with cholesterol problems whose doctors want to use Lipidil for vision loss will be able to get the drug at the subsidised price of $5.90 for pensioners and $36.10 for general consumers.
Those without a cholesterol problem will be able to get it via a private prescription for around $42 a month.
Ophthalmologist Dr Stephen Ong says he's seeing more and more young patients who are still working and trying to support children losing their vision from diabetes.
He's urging people with diabetes to have their eyes checked regularly. Diabetes Australia says Diabetic Retinopathy can occur regardless of the control you have over your blood-glucose levels.

Diabetes test hope
SCIENTISTS are developing a test using a living biobank of blood donations from generous Victorians as part of an ambitious bid to develop a vaccine for type 1 diabetes.
The St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research team were the first in the world to watch immune cells destroy the body's insulin-producing cells in the human pancreas.
They discovered the immune cells were targeting a molecule called the C-peptide. Now they are developing a blood test to measure the immune response to this molecule, which may lead to the development of type 1 diabetes.
Their aim is to design a therapy that teaches the immune system not to attack the insulin-producing cells.
""That's our long term goal,"" immunologist Associate Professor Stuart Mannering said.
""The next step towards this is to measure that immune response in blood samples so we can try to detect it before people develop symptoms of type 1 diabetes.
""The problem with the auto-immune disease is that it can take a long time to develop, and if you have a vaccine that may prevent it, and you treat people with it, you have to wait a long time to see how many people don't get the disease to know if the vaccine works.
""What we would really like is a blood test that we can do after a much shorter period of time so that we can see if the immune response is going in the direction we want it."" The blood test will be developed using samples from a living biobank, a registry of people offering to give blood samples for medical research.
""The living biobank is really essential because it allows us to do this study using human blood from people with and without diabetes and that's a really critical stepping stone... to more human-based studies so we can develop something that will be useful in the clinic,"" Prof Mannering said.
The research will get a boost today when it receives Diabetes Australia's 2017 Millennium Award of $150,000.
""The holy grail of diabetes research is a cure and we will continue to invest in research until that becomes a reality,"" its CEO Associate Professor Greg Johnson said.

Take a walk to stave off diabetes 
HERE'S another reason to ditch the car keys and put on your trainers. Walking to work each day could cut your chances of developing diabetes, claim researchers.
They found people who get to work under their own steam are around 40 per cent less likely to have the disease as those who drive.
Experts at Imperial College London and University College London examined how health is affected by the way people travel to work, using a survey of 20,000 Britons.
They found cycling, walking, and using public transport were all associated with a lower risk of being overweight than driving or taking a taxi.
Those who walked to work were far less likely to have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes than drivers, and had a 17 per cent lower risk of high blood pressure.
Cyclists were around half as likely to have diabetes as those who drove. In the study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, British scientists used survey data from 2009-11 to find the links between active travel to work and diabetes or hypertension.
Anthony Laverty, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, who led the research, said: ""This study highlights that building physical activity into the daily routine by walking, cycling or using public transport to get to work is good for personal health. ""It demonstrates associations between active travel to work and a reduced likelihood of being overweight, having diabetes and having hypertension.""

Milkshakes increase diabetes risk
SUGAR Nazis rejoice - a new study shows every sugar-sweetened drink you give up each day will cut your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 14 to 25 per cent.
And sweetened milk drinks such as milkshakes have emerged as a greater threat than soft drinks.
But tea, coffee and juice drinkers can take heart because some sweetened drinks are better than others.
Soft drinks, cordials and sweetened milk contribute to higher type 2 diabetes risk while sweetened coffee and tea, and fruit juice do not.
A Cambridge University study published today in Diabetologia found replacing a serving of soft drinks with a serving of water or unsweetened tea or coffee, cuts the risk of diabetes by 14 per cent.
But surprisingly, replacing a serving of sweetened milk beverage with water or unsweetened tea or coffee cuts your diabetes risk by between 20 to 25 per cent.
Researchers studied the impact of sweetened drinks on more than 25,000 men and women aged 40-79 in the UK. Every time you increase your consumption of sweet drinks by 5 per cent of your total energy intake, you increase your type 2 diabetes risk by 18 per cent, the study found.

Big surge in diabetes alarms health experts
A surge in type 2 diabetes and pregnancy-related diabetes has alarmed health experts, with almost one in 20 West Australians now having problems controlling blood glucose levels.
The latest snapshot shows that at the end of last month, 98,125 people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, an increase of 7000, or 19 people a day in the past 12 months.
Gestational diabetes, which has been rising alongside obesity rates, now makes up a quarter of all new diabetes diagnoses, with almost 2500 cases in the past year, a 22 per cent increase.
The figures, released for National Diabetes Week starting today, show forms of diabetes linked to obesity, poor diet and lack of exercise are eclipsing the number of new cases of type 1 diabetes, which fell 10 per cent in the past year.
Diabetes WA chief executive Andrew Wagstaff said the figures showed that every day another 28 West Australians would be given the life-altering diagnosis of diabetes, but it was the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes that was most concerning.
Nine out of 10 of the 112,000 West Australians with diabetes had type 2, a condition which in many cases could be avoided, while type 1 diabetes was an autoimmune condition that could not be prevented.
""People tend to underestimate the seriousness of type 2 diabetes, yet the effect of this condition on a person's life, and the lives of those who care for them, is immeasurable,"" Mr Wagstaff said.
""Along with the everyday challenges that go with maintaining healthy blood glucose levels, people with type 2 diabetes are at risk of a series of complications including limb amputations, impaired vision and kidney failure.""
Mr Wagstaff said in up to 60 per cent of cases, people could delay or entirely prevent type 2 diabetes by adopting a healthier lifestyle.

Surgeons kept busy while we wait for diabetes plan
Hospital beds filled with amputees is a phenomenon most Australians would associate with last century's world wars, not the 21st century. If only it was confined to history. Modern Australia, like the rest of the world, is fighting a battle with type 2 diabetes that it is losing. Our energy-dense diets and sedentary lifestyles are making us sick. Hospital wards are filled with the casualties.
Today The Sun-Herald reports that a rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has led to a 25 per cent increase in amputations in just two years. The foot clinic at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has a long waiting list. One Tasmanian surgeon is conducting an amputation a week.
But losing a foot or a lower leg is only one of many serious consequences arising from the condition. It can cause heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, deafness and blindness, depression and anxiety.
Around 1.1 million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and a further 500,000 are estimated to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. While all types are increasing, type 2, associated with lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise and obesity, accounts for 85 per cent of all cases.
Already the rise in type 2 is placing a strain on the medical system, with diabetes accounting for around one third of all preventable hospital admissions, and it is destined to get worse. These cases are predicted to become the single biggest contributor to the burden of disease on the Australian health system by 2017.
As individuals we can make a difference to our chances of contracting type 2 diabetes or slow its progression. While certain risk factors - our age, genetic inheritance and ethnicity - are beyond our control, diet, weight and exercise are not. And even small lifestyle adjustments can help.
But to make the biggest advances in this battle, we need governments to lead the effort. The federal Coalition has made some headway in doing that. In 2013, it made an election pledge to deliver a national diabetes strategy. In government it established a National Diabetes Strategy Advisory Group, which included some of the top experts in the field. The group delivered its advice to government in August last year and in November, the Minister for Health Sussan Ley released the strategy.
Unfortunately, it has disappointed key members of the advisory group. A proposed National Diabetes Commission to drive change was omitted, while ""major recommendations for prevention and care on maternal and child health"" were also missing, group co-chair Paul Zimmet and his colleague Stephen Colagiuri wrote in an opinion piece this weekend. Now that COAG has adopted the strategy, Zimmet and Colagiuri want diabetes experts to be involved in the next stage of the federal and state governments' response: planning how to implement it.
The government has promised the strategy and the advisory group's earlier document will both be taken into account in this next stage and that it will continue to consult with advisory group members. We would feel more confident with these assurances if a specific role was created for these experts to help translate the strategy into action.
Meanwhile, the surgeons are kept busy.

Diabetes diet hope
A MEDICINAL diet that boosts good bacteria in our gut may be key to reducing the risk of type 1 diabetes, a common chronic disease in children.
Monash University-led research has shown for the first time that a special combination of fermentable fibre can stop mice developing diabetes.
The fibre could be taken as a powder sprinkled on food, and plans are now under way for a human trial in the hope of either preventing the auto-immune disease or reducing patients' reliance on medication.
Developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and refined by the university, the diet's combination of resistant starches is broken down by gut bacteria to produce the short-chain fatty acids acetate and butyrate. These metabolites are emerging as a key part of keeping the immune system healthy.
""We think that metabolites have anti-inflammatory effects and they do remarkable things in every single major disease we look at: cardiovascular disease, food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma,"" the university's Professor Charles Mackay said.
He and colleague Dr Eliana Marino, from the university's Biomedicine Discovery Institute, tested the diet on laboratory mice that had already developed diabetes.
""And we still managed to protect the mice from developing full-blown diabetes,"" he said. ""It would be awesome if (it) holds true for humans."" Though the starches are found in food, Prof Mackay said it was unlikely a healthy diet alone could provide the fibre at the levels needed.
""It can't be replicated just by eating high amounts of fruit and vegetables,"" he said.
""It's a supplement you could sprinkle on your food that would give you an enormous hit of acetate or butyrate, or both. It could be a tremendous way to get our gut back to good health and prevent these inflammatory diseases."" While type 1 diabetes has a genetic basis, Prof Mackay believes our Western diet, which lacks dietary fibre, could be behind an increasing incidence of inflammatory diseases such as asthma and food allergies.
Jodie Lester, 43, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for more than 30 years, said she would try anything that could reduce the risk of her children developing the disease.
Trial findings are being published in the journal Nature Immunology today.

Other diabetes treatments also listed include linagliptin (Trajenta), linagliptin with metformin (Trajentamet) and vildagliptin (Galvus). Ms Ley said the listings were expected to be cost-neutral because the drugs were alternatives to existing treatments.

Type 1 kit to woo votes
THOUSANDS of kids with Type 1 diabetes will be given pocket-sized continuous glucose monitoring devices that will save lives and spare families $4000 a year.
Saving kids from being woken up in the middle of the night for blood tests to check their glucose levels, the new kits can also be combined with insulin pumps to provide more accurate doses.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will announce today that if re-elected, his Government will devote $54 million to ensure that thousands of families can secure the pocket-sized gadgets for the first time.
In his first major health policy announcement of the campaign, the PM will confirm that all children and young adults under 21 will be eligible.
""Our commitment is estimated to benefit as many as 4000 children and young adults, and could save the average family up to $4000 per year off the cost of managing their child's Type 1 diabetes,"" Mr Turnbull said.
""It will help reduce possible visits to emergency departments and missed school days by allowing families to better self-manage the diabetes.
""Most importantly, it will help reduce stress and anxiety for children and their parents, and even save lives."" The Prime Minister has also averted an election war with pathologists over their threats to leave patients out-of-pocket for blood, urine and Pap smear tests in a separate deal that will cap rents at collection centres.
The fight with pathologists had sparked warnings that tests could soon cost patients $30 and triggered a major campaign in marginal seats.
Today's announcement on a new deal to help kids with diabetes was hailed by Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation CEO Mike Wilson as a win for families who had campaigned for years for subsidies.
Providing 24-hour day glucose monitoring, the kits monitor blood-sugar levels through a small device that is inserted under the skin and left in place for up to 6 days.
""With Type 1 diabetes you need insulin to stay alive and you can be diagnosed when just a few months old,"" Mr Wilson said. ""Most commonly, the diagnosis is marked by a week to 10 days in hospital with significant fears for the life of the child.
""You've got to deliver that insulin four or five times a day just to stay alive or risk complication including blindness and heart disease, kidney failure and even amputation ""Continuous glucose monitoring gives you real-time visibility as what your blood sugars are. It means greatly reduced risk of fluctuation that can lead to coma and death.
""It doesn't have to be an error on behalf of the parent, blood sugar levels can be complicated by heat levels, stress, exercise and hormones with puberty. Your blood sugar levels can go high or low very quickly.
""It will reduce to remove the need for these kids to do 10-15 finger pricks a day. By the time they are teenagers that can be nearly 40,000."" The Turnbull Government estimates it will save families up to $50,000 based on the average diagnosis, and over time it could save families up to $90,000 if a child has to monitor from birth through to 21.

Researchers give type 1 diabetics fresh hope
Rosina Pavlovic isn't overstating things when she says her son Dane's diabetes dominates her life and that of her family.
""It's huge, it consumes our life,"" she said.
Cooking at home when the meal can be tailored is one thing. But going out for dinner invariably means counting carbs before consuming. If it's pizza, Dane's favourite meal, the thickness of the base, size of the slices and toppings are closely scrutinised.
Diagnosed as a five-year-old, Dane (pictured) has type 1 diabetes which demands around-the-clock monitoring. It's not uncommon for his father, Zlatan, to stay up until 1am to do one last finger prick test to make sure Dane's blood sugar levels are OK and he can get through the night.
Now 10, Dane is getting to grips with managing his diabetes and is well-versed in explaining why he might need to stop playing basketball mid-game or remove himself from the classroom.
""He lives a life of compromises,"" Mrs Pavlovic said of her youngest son.
But it may not always be the case for type 1 diabetes patients, after research by American and Australian scientists established what causes the body to mistakenly attack and destroy its own insulin-producing cells.
The international team found that when two protein fragments in beta cells, the cells that secrete insulin, collided they formed a hybrid which the body's immune system mistakenly identified as a foreign object to be destroyed. This leaves people with type 1 diabetes unable to produce insulin, the hormone that regulates the body's use of glucose.
University of Colorado research first identified the scenario in mice and it was confirmed in humans by scientists at St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne.
The findings, published in the journal Science on Friday, will help medical researchers intervene to stop the body attacking itself - potentially meaning a new treatment for those diagnosed with the condition.
St Vincent's immunologist Stuart Mannering said the goal was to be able to ""vaccinate"" against auto-immune diseases such as type 1 diabetes.
Mrs Pavlovic knows the results will still be a few years off, but welcomed the news.
""It's amazing,"" she said. ""We're closer to finding a way to prevent it and to cure it.""

Start for diabetes support
WA's first dedicated centre for managing juvenile diabetes could be helping families by next year after the State Government donated land at Osborne Park Hospital to the cause.
The Telethon Juvenile Diabetes Family Centre, to be built with funds from Telethon and Lotterywest, will provide children and teenagers with type 1 diabetes and their families with support on top of their mainstream hospital care.
It will house a psychologist, diabetes nurse, support group, education facilities and a state-of-the-art kitchen to help young sufferers learn how to eat to best manage their disease.
Health Minister Kim Hames toured the 1630sqm block of land, valued at $1.08 million, with centre chairman Jeff Newman yesterday.
Professor of endocrinology and diabetes Tim Jones, who is based at Princess Margaret Hospital and will lead the project, said the centre would complement the medical care children received at PMH and fulfil an unmet need for support for teenagers after they left PMH.
""PMH provides great medical care, but when you've got chronic disease you need support in the community and you need support for your whole life,"" Professor Jones said.
""It also will provide support for children when they leave PMH, that transition period, that dangerous time between 16 and 20.""
Mr Newman said he hoped the centre would help young sufferers accept their diabetes and carry on with their lives without seeing it as a burden.

Naps now not best for health
IF YOU were thinking about catching 40 winks this afternoon, you might want to make a cuppa instead.
While naps may jump-start tired brains, researchers found that dozing for more than 30 minutes can also increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.
The study of 27,009 people aged 45 or over found that of those who took naps, 40 per cent had high blood pressure, compared to 33 per cent who didn't take siestas.
And 24 per cent of afternoon sleepers had high cholesterol, versus 19 per cent of those who stayed awake.
The findings are in contrast to other recent studies which found naps can boost brain power and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by more than a third.
Researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China, said napping for less than half an hour, or not at all, reduced the chance of developing diabetes.
Researchers checked participants' health by measuring the sugar in their blood. Naps could also disrupt the body's internal clock and put extra stress on organs.

Time to get healthy together
IF your spouse or partner has type 2 diabetes it increases your risk of having it, too, according to the latest expert opinion.

Health wrap diabetes site
The Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre has come to fruition through the support of several WA organisations.
Officially opened today, the $2.8 million facility was built next to the Osborne Park Hospital in Stirling on land donated by the State Government with grants from Lotterywest and Telethon.
The two-storey building, constructed by BGC Construction, includes six clinical rooms, a kids' play area, an adolescents' lounge, a kitchen, workshop and seminar area, and an upstairs boardroom and meeting room.
BGC's unit development manager, John Irvine, said construction began on the 1640sqm block in April last year and took about 13 months.
""A number of the major subcontractors involved with BGC Construction on the project assisted either by way of donations in material or time to keep the cost as low as possible to enable the organisation to channel funds where more were required,"" he said. ""The end result is a fantastic facility which BGC Construction is very proud to be associated with.
""The nature of the building made it fairly complex to construct. The facade consists of a number of curved walls which, combined with the overall curved nature of the structural steel roof, made it a fairly difficult roof to complete.""
Fred Zuideveld, director of Zuideveld Marchant Hur Architects, said the curves were incorporated to bring people into the space, while the light-filled design offered a visual connection to the outside.
""The brief was that it was not a clinical centre,"" he said.
""It was to be more of a place where families could come for check-ups and advice and also to meet other families. It should be a place where they feel relaxed and can easily mix together.
""With the entrance protected from the west for weather purposes, it leads into a nice flowing pattern that opens into a cafe-type space and reception area and then on to the rooms where people can get together or wait before going through to offices.""
For interior designer Lynnette Kohler, of Lynnette Kohler Design, her aim was to create a relaxed, homely feel.
""The No. 1 priority was to keep the clinical side of the centre as low key as possible - including the actual treatment rooms,"" she said. ""The centre is dedicated to children and young adults with diabetes, so we wanted them to feel relaxed and for their families to feel as comfortable as possible.""
The rooms were furnished with items from Ikea and Anthony Murrays Furniture.
""I didn't want the waiting area to be your usual rows of chairs, so chose the large curved sofas to float in the space and encourage interaction - the space flows from one area to another and through to outside so visitors feel relaxed and children can play freely,"" Ms Kohler said.

Diabetes epidemic makes early detection of eye problems vital
Ophthalmologists and peak health groups are calling on Australians with diabetes to seek early testing and treatment for eye diseases, despite the approval of a new drug on Thursday. Researcher Dr Peter van Wijngaarden, a fellow with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists, said diabetes was the leading cause of vision loss in Australia and could be avoided with early detection. ""Diabetes is an epidemic in Australia at the moment and we think the number of people known to have a diagnosis is around 1.2 million,"" he said. ""But there are another 500,000 people with diabetes in the community who don't know they have it, so we think there around 1.7 million in total."" Dr van Wijngaarden, who is also the principal investigator at the Centre for Eye Research Australia, said many people were not aware diabetes was linked with vision loss. ""The eye tends to be forgotten, as most GPs don't have the equipment or the skill sets to examine eyes for diabetic changes, so it falls out of the primary care focus,"" he said. ""By the time people present with symptoms the disease is often very advanced."" RANZCO and a number of peak body organisations, including Diabetes Australia, have formed a working group and intend to present the federal government with a proposal for an early screening program to encourage detection. Dr van Wijngaarden said the proposal would be presented within two months and would adapt a British program that had reduced diabetes as a leading cause of blindness and vision loss. ""We know from studies that about 100 per cent of people with type-one diabetes will have some degree of eye disease and around 60 per cent of those with type two diabetes will develop some form of it within 20 years,"" he said. ""The key message is that the vast majority of vision loss and blindness can be avoided through early detection."" Dr van Wijngaarden's public call comes a day after the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved a new drug called EYLEA, used to treat diabetic macular oedema in adults. Dr Andrew Chang, the owner and operator of the Sydney Retina Clinic and Day Surgery, said the drug would provide doctors with another tool to combat vision loss. ""It is important that Australians with diabetes who are concerned about their sight or have suspected DME discuss the appropriate testing and treatment approach with their ophthalmologist,"" he said. Dr van Wijngaarden said injection treatments improved the vision of people with established diabetic diseases, but there was a heavy financial cost. ""It's an exciting stage but they are highly costly and if they are used alone without addressing the risk then there is a potential need for frequent use, which can be very expensive,"" he said. ""That's just the direct drug cost, but this has to be administered by an eye specialist in a dedicated facility, so the actual administration cost is extremely expensive."" Dr van Wijngaarden said the drug cost for similar products was ""in the order of $1000 per injection"" with some patients requiring up to seven injections a year.

Tax will save our lives
MORE people in Queensland have diabetes than the populations of Townsville and Toowoomba combined and the numbers are growing at a shocking rate with 60 new diagnoses a day.
""There are 315,000 living with type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes and 93,000 of the people with type 2 do not know they have it. That is the population of a big city, bigger than the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns or Toowoomba,"" Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said.
Diabetes costs Queensland hospitals $610 million a year.
Former state president of the Australian Medical Association and current board and council chairman Shaun Rudd said the only way to put a halt to surging numbers of ""lifestyle"" type 2 cases was ""taxation, legislation and regulation"".
""I hate to say it, but education is just not working. It is difficult to turn around unhealthy habits and changes need to be enforced rather than leaving people to do it for themselves,"" Dr Rudd said.
""In Queensland, diabetes has no postcode but is readily identified by the ever-present risk of medical complications and consequences, from kidney and heart disease to blindness and amputation,"" Ms Trute said.
A large number of diabetes cases are preventable. Simple lifestyle changes can be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. Maintaining normal body weight, regular exercise and healthy eating can reduce the risk. Ms Trute said 30 minutes of exercise a day could halve the risk of type 2 diabetes.
""Five vegetables and two fruit a day, plus regular exercise, is good practice for everyone,"" she said.
Brisbane's Ashleigh Ricardo, 26, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes four years ago when she was extremely tired and had a huge thirst.

The US study suggests, along with previous research, that people with diabetes may have a greater chance of developing dementia.

UNDER THE PUMP
Teachers too busy to monitor diabetic kids MANY Queensland teachers are too busy or scared to administer life-saving medication to prep and primary pupils.
A change to legislation, coming this month, that will give them statutory protection from liability is unlikely to fix the dilemma of who should care for the rising numbers of pupils with specialised health needs.
Teacher aides are reportedly coming under pressure to take on the job. Under Department of Education regulations school staff are not compelled to administer insulin or other medication but are offered training if they volunteer.
Diabetes Queensland said there were 2000 children in the state with Type 1 diabetes. According to Queensland Health, food allergies are most common in young children, the age group that may need more assistance.
""More teachers are coming forward with this issue,"" Queensland Teachers' Union president Kevin Bates said.
"" While I welcome the positive changes to the liability issue, I don't think it will have an impact on how teachers feel. It is an emotional, not a legislative issue.
""Teachers care about the children but are overworked. They are not in a position to leave more than 20 children unattended while they monitor one child.
""In the ideal world a qualified nurse would be available at schools but failing that there needs to be a pragmatic solution."" The teacher aide union United Voice Queensland told The Sunday Mail they saw increased incidences of schools putting pressure on aides to take on the job. Its education co-ordinator Michael Clifford said: ""Teacher aides are not health professionals and as such are under no obligation to administer insulin to students or monitor their blood sugar levels."" Emma Glann has an eight-year-old son with Type 1 diabetes who attends Upper Coomera State School. Emma has had to give up her full-time job to be on hand to monitor Tyler.
""It is too worrying to leave him in the hands of other people,"" she said. ""I know how busy teachers are and it is too easy to miss things. They are not medical experts. It is a life-threatening condition and it is important not to make someone else responsible for my son's life."" David Olivier, 7, attends Belmont State School in Brisbane.

Diabetes linked to mental illness
Children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes are twice as likely to develop mental health conditions during early adulthood than their non-diabetic peers, researchers have found.
The link between the illness and how it influences the development of mental health disorders is yet to be determined.
Telethon Kids Institute PhD student Matthew Cooper presented the findings of the data linkage study to the World Diabetes Congress in Canada.
They show diabetic children are twice as likely to develop anxiety, eating and personality and behaviour disorders during their maturity than their non-diabetic peers.
Researchers compared the health records of the 1300 West Australian children diagnosed with diabetes over the past 20 years with the records of 6000, non-diabetics of the same age and gender. They were more likely to be simultaneously affected by more than one psychiatric disorder, Mr Cooper said.
""While the data has some limitations, we're concerned as these conditions were more common among those that died during follow up,"" he said.
The research was overseen by Elizabeth Davis of Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for Children. She said mental health disorders occurred at a higher rate among patients with a history of poor blood sugar level control, which the study found was the only factor associated with an increased risk of mental health disorder.
Professor Davis said the onset of conditions could be spurred by the stresses of living with the chronic disease, including the constant monitoring of blood sugar levels and complex care plans.
She said there had been previous studies on the issue that delivered mixed findings, but this was a larger study that provided a ""true reflection"" of the occurrence of mental health conditions in type 1 diabetic children.
""At a clinical level, I think this data is really important for us to recognise diabetes is a very stressful condition, for both the children and the parents, because the whole family is impacted by something like diabetes,"" she said.
Professor Davis said the study highlighted the need for thorough mental health screening of diabetic children.
The research team would seek additional funding to determine what was driving an ""increased incidence of mental health"". She encouraged parents with diabetic children to have them undergo mental health screening that could detect ""early warning signs"" that they were not coping and were developing mental health conditions.

Walking away from diabetes
A new program helps women with gestational diabetes manage the chance of further illness, writes PETA RASDIEN
As the number of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes soars, women are being urged to be vigilant about maintaining a healthy lifestyle in order to minimise their increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Even though symptoms of gestational diabetes usually abate once the baby is born, mothers retain a one-in-two chance of developing type 2 diabetes within 10-30 years.
National Diabetes Services Scheme statistics show 33,480 women were diagnosed with gestational diabetes in 2015.
Changes to diagnostic criteria which capture more cases, a growing awareness of the condition and better registration have all contributed to a doubling in the number of gestational diabetes cases since 2011.
However, experts believe there is also a likely growth in the prevalence of gestational diabetes generally, similar to the growth seen in type 2 diabetes.
""Type 2 diabetes is on the rise so it's reasonable to assume that gestational diabetes is also on the rise because women who are diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are likely to have the same genetic risk factors as people with type 2 diabetes,"" diabetes educator with Diabetes WA and former midwife June Lee said.
Ms Lee said gestational diabetes was caused by placental hormones which helped babies to grow and thrive but could also increase insulin resistance.
This can result in big babies who may require instrumental or surgical intervention during birth.
Importantly, it also permanently raises the mother's future risk of type 2 diabetes.
The good news, though, according to Ms Lee, is that lifestyle changes can minimise your risk.
Walking Away from Diabetes, a new program developed by Diabetes WA, helps women diagnosed with gestational diabetes learn how to tackle their long-term risk.
Women can self-refer or ask their GP to refer them into the program.
""We encourage women if they have put on weight during pregnancy to look at ways they can reduce their weight. It is a practical approach that empowers women to make the changes and to work with GPs or child-health nurses,"" she said.
""If a woman who has a history of gestational diabetes is planning another pregnancy later we want her to be in the best possible health for that pregnancy.""
This involved being active by trying to incorporate 30 minutes of exercise on most days and eating a healthy balanced diet.
Women who have had gestational diabetes in the past are advised to seek blood-glucose testing every one to two years.
Walking Away from Diabetes is a three-hour program being held in venues across Perth until next month. Reservations are necessary and can be arranged by phoning Diabetes WA on 9436 6268 or email bookings@diabeteswa.com.au.
For more about gestational diabetes go to diabeteswa.com.au or call the Diabetes WA Information and Advice Line (DIAL) 1300 136 588.
From 5-10 per cent of pregnant women will develop gestational diabetes.
All women are tested for gestational diabetes as part of the 24-28 week routine check-up with their GP.
Gestational diabetes that is not well controlled can result in a big baby requiring intervention during birth, miscarriage and stillbirth.
Women from some ethnic backgrounds have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes, these include: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, Vietnamese, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Polynesian and Melanesian women.
Other risk factors for gestational diabetes include; being older than 25 years of age, a family history of type 2 or gestational diabetes, being overweight, gestational diabetes during previous pregnancies, previously birthing a big baby or having previously had polycystic ovary syndrome.

ASK THE NATUROPATH
A blood test has shown that I have high insulin levels. My doctor says it's a sign I have insulin resistance and could be heading towards type 2 diabetes. What does insulin do? And what can I do to reduce it?
Insulin is a hormone made by beta cells, which are found in the romantic-sounding but rather mundane Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It helps to maintain the blood's glucose levels by controlling the glucose channels and allowing it to cross cell membranes to be used for energy.
Beta cells are destroyed in type 1 diabetes, and without them insulin can't be created. In these cases, insulin needs to be injected into the body.
In the early stages of type 2 diabetes (the most common form), the cells start to resist the hormone's instruction to allow glucose to enter cells, causing blood sugar levels to rise - this is insulin resistance.
CAUSES OF INSULIN RESISTANCE
As well as being linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is also associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, sleep apnoea, high blood pressure and some cancers.
Resistance can be inherited, however, lifestyle factors play an enormous role in causing it, with inactivity and overeating the biggest concerns. Other risk factors include high blood sugar levels, elevated triglycerides (blood fat), ageing and taking certain medications.
HERBS AND MINERALS THAT HELP
Natural ways to lower blood glucose and reduce insulin resistance include herbs such as goat's rue, gymnema, cinnamon, Panax (Korean) ginseng and fenugreek. Also try supplements of chromium, zinc, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D, fish oil, alpha-lipoic acid and B-complex vitamins.
EASY LIFESTYLE CHANGES
Muscle contraction improves the uptake of glucose by cells. Muscles contract when you exercise, and 30 minutes daily has been shown to decrease insulin resistance.
Adding certain foods to your daily diet can assist in your body's blood-sugar regulation. Try including legumes, oats, cinnamon (add a teaspoon to your cereal or smoothie), fenugreek, blueberries and bitter melon (bitter gourd). Studies have also shown that soluble fibre enhances insulin sensitivity, as well as slowing the release of sugar into the bloodstream.
Good sources of soluble fibre are fruit, vegetables, legumes, oats, psyllium husks, chia seeds, nuts and seeds.
Avoid eating sugar and refined flour products such as cakes and white bread. Having a glass of wine with a meal has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.

Doctors treating 'waddling' toddlers for obesity Kids too fat to breathe
AUSTRALIAN children are growing so fat that doctors are removing their tonsils to help them breathe.
Overweight kids as young as 10 are developing ""late onset"" diabetes, an illness that normally afflicts the middle-aged.
And medical specialists are treating 36kg ""waddling"" toddlers for obesity.
The Federal Government's National Health and Medical Research Council wants parents to fight the flab by feeding children healthier food and making them do more exercise.
The council's draft new obesity guidelines recommend ""weight maintenance"" instead of weight loss for fat children.
But one of the nation's three specialist centres for treating childhood obesity, the Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, has warned the council that some kids are so obese they must lose weight through meal plans and exercise.
Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton said some parents did not even notice their children were overweight.
""There's a new norm once you get 25 per cent of children and 60 per cent of adults obese,"" he said yesterday.
""They look in the mirror and think they don't look too bad.""
Twenty per cent of Tasmanian children are overweight and 64 per cent of those aged 18 and over are overweight or obese, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures reveal.
Westmead's paediatric obesity staff specialist Shirley Alexander said the hospital was treating toddlers as young as 18 months.
Some two-year-olds weighed 36kg - three times the recommended body weight - and waddled rather than walked.
Dr Alexander said seven and eight-year-olds had been fitted with CPAP machines to help them breathe at night - while others had their tonsils removed to help them breathe.
And young children had been given hip operations because they were so heavy their joints gave out.
""We've got five, six and seven-year-olds with insulin resistance and 10-year-olds with type-2 diabetes,"" Dr Alexander said.
""It used to be 30 years ago you didn't see that until people were in their 40s, 50s and 60s.""
Dr Alexander said society had become ""obesogenic"".
""We spend more time in cars, more time sitting on our bottoms watching screens, be it at work or homework or watching TV,"" she said.
""Bigger is becoming more of the norm now.""
The council's final obesity guidelines the first update in a decade are due to be released mid-year.

""They're the people who are actually lucky: their body is giving them an alert to say 'you haven't been eating the right food the last month and I'm not feeling comfortable' and 'you haven't been going on walks this week, what's going on?'  "" About 40 per cent of type 2 diabetes cases are induced by other lifestyle factors outside of weight, such as smoking. Ms Trute said thin people's ill-health was disguised and unseen fat around their organs was a ""ticking time bomb"".

Wake-up call for hidden diabetes
OVERWEIGHT Queenslanders need to wake up to themselves and confront their unhealthy lifestyles to prevent diabetes ruining their health.
People should not be hiding behind makeup or clothes and convincing themselves they are healthy when in reality they are a ""ticking time bomb"", Diabetes Queensland said.
New figures from the National Diabetes Services Scheme show about 186,000 Queenslanders are living with diagnosed type-2 diabetes.
But Diabetes Queensland believes more than half a million Queenslanders are obliviously living with undiagnosed type-2 diabetes, have pre-diabetes or are at high risk of developing the condition.
People ignore symptoms of their diabetes and go undiagnosed, on average, for five to seven years.
Unquenchable thirst, moodiness, fatigue, frequenting the bathroom, blurred vision and dizziness are all symptoms diabetics can easily ignore by putting them down to ageing or working too hard.
But experts warn that ignoring these symptoms for years can lead to irreversible organ damage.
Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said people ""are ticking time bombs"" and they needed to prioritise their health.
""We need a way to cut through to the people who think it's not going to happen to them,"" Ms Trute said.
""(We need to get through to) the person who looks in the mirror and thinks I've got makeup on and my hair is blow dried so I look OK but in reality you're carrying 10kg more than you should but you're disguising it in the clothes you're wearing.
""We know when we do the surveys that everyone thinks it'll happen to someone else, not them. The problem is Australians have a way of saying 'she'll be right' but you can't jeopardise your health with that.
""Queenslanders need to get realistic about their own lifestyle. We live in an amazing state and it's so easy to watch sport and watch people doing triathlons rather than donning the bib yourself and going for the run."" She said diabetes had to be considered as a separate issue from obesity despite 60 per cent of cases linked to lifestyle factors such as overeating and under-exercising.
Family history, age and being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander are also risk factors.
""Type-2 diabetes is the gate keeping to so many other diseases like heart failure and stroke and amputations,"" Ms Trute said.
If people have symptoms they should seek medical advice soon as possible before irreversible damage is done.""(After delaying diagnosis) the damage they do to their internal organs then is irreversible. Then they get diagnosed and they go on the right path and look at weight and exercising and blood glucose levels but the damage has still been done.""

Friendly advice helps change diabetics' lives
In the days when diabetes educator Eileen Collins ran marathons and didn't have children, she says she advised a 40-something woman with diabetes whose lifestyle was so maxed-out that wedging in time for regular exercise felt impossible.
When Collins tried to motivate her to make lifestyle changes, it backfired, but proved a valuable career experience, adds Collins.
""I remember saying to her, 'I get up really early in the morning and do the running before work.'
""I saw her eyes glaze over and I realised even then that I'd lost her; that that was just such a stupid thing to say. Whereas now I might say, 'Do you think there's any way you can fit some physical activity into your life?' And if they say no, I leave it there.""
Collins, Diabetes Victoria's education services team leader, says her role largely centres around ""informing, empowering, supporting and explaining"".
She sees clients to determine if other conditions are affecting their diabetes; educates them about medication, insulin, food and exercise, ensures they're having required screenings done and monitors their health and wellbeing.
She estimates she devotes half her time to supporting clients and the other half to team leadership.
""I like supporting the younger staff members and assisting them with their development,"" she says.
""We've got a great team and they've all got great skills, but some are less experienced, so I love it when they ask for my advice and support in their work.""
Collins, who works in a general practice one day a week, has a graduate diploma in health education, and nursing and midwifery experience. She joined Diabetes Victoria seven years ago and started her current role last year. Collins has 25 years' experience as a diabetes educator and says volunteering as a nurse educator in Western Samoa in the 1980s was valuable.
""Living and working in another culture gives you a perspective on your own culture and your own country,"" she says.
""Nowadays, when we're talking to people with diabetes we realise we have to be aware of things like health literacy and that was probably the first place I learned...
""We also saw a lot of people living with diabetes who didn't have the opportunities that a lot of people in Australia have with the care of their diabetes and it made me appreciate that.""
One of Collins' next goals is to contribute to developing more Diabetes Victoria educational resources for clients of diverse literacies. ""We're always learning,"" she says. ""I've been in diabetes education for 25 years and there have been so many changes.""

Apple's watch to monitor diabetes
Medical device maker DexCom is designing an app that will display readings from its diabetes glucose monitor on Apple's upcoming smartwatch, giving the watch an early foothold in the healthcare market.
DexCom's glucose monitor tracks a person's blood-sugar levels continuously. The company has shown a picture of the app, which converts that data into a simple graph that is just a glance at the wrist away. It says the app is expected to be ready when the Apple Watch is launched in April.
Apple declined to comment. The company hasn't accepted any apps for the coming watch yet but has provided guidelines and code to developers for creating apps for it. The latest iPhone operating system increased its health and fitness offerings.
The US Food and Drug Administration had been closely scrutinising such applications. But the agency loosened its oversight in late January, months after a group of software engineers, many of whose children have Type 1 diabetes, developed a system for monitoring diabetes patients' blood sugar over the internet. The system was distributed without first getting regulatory approval.
The group's effort challenged the slow pace of innovation and regulatory approval in the field. It also highlighted the growing role that Silicon Valley companies and software developers hope to have in monitoring and maintaining people's health.
The DexCom monitor uses a hair's-width sensor under the skin to measure blood glucose levels every five minutes.
Previously, the FDA considered glucose monitors to be Class III medical devices, meaning they received the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. But the spread of NightScout, the system developed by the group of software engineers, and DexCom's submission of a separate iPhone app for review prompted the FDA to change course.
DexCom's monitors will remain Class III devices, but software that helps display the data they produce on mobile devices or smartwatches now only needs to be registered with the FDA and doesn't require prior marketing approval.
The FDA has been reassessing its health-apps policies. ""We felt that the risks that the app imposed weren't as high,"" said Alberto Gutierrez, director of the FDA's Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. NightScout software takes data from the glucose monitor, mainly for Type 1 diabetes patients, and uploads it to the internet. That allows parents - and caregivers - to keep track of their children's blood sugar from afar via their cellphones, tablets and Pebble watches.

Caffeine thwarts diabetes 
THE daily fix of caffeine has been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes according to a new study by Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH).
Researchers found that coffee consumption lowered women's risk of type 2 diabetes by 8 per cent. Men lowered their risk 4 per cent by drinking regular coffee and, interestingly, 7 per cent for decaf.
The findings drew on data from around 80,000 women and 40,000 men in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.
Dr Rob van Dam, Assistant Professor in the Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health said the news for coffee drinkers was good overall.
""At the start of the study, these healthy men and women were in their 40s and 50s.
""We followed them for 18 to 24 years, to see who died during that period, and to track their diet and lifestyle habits, including coffee consumption.
""We did not find any relationship between coffee consumption and increased risk of death from any cause, death from cancer, or death from cardiovascular disease. ""Even people who drank up to six cups of coffee per day were at no higher risk of death.""

Diabetes risk from job stress
OVERDOING it at work is bound to make you tired, grumpy and stressed. But research suggests it could also significantly increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes - even if you're not overweight.
A major study has found that those under the most strain at work are 45 per cent more likely to fall ill with the condition, which increases the risk of heart disease, strokes, blindness and amputations.
The study, from the Institute of Epidemiology in Munich, followed 5337 men and women who were in full-time work. Over a 12-year period, nearly 300 of the subjects - who were previously healthy - developed type 2 diabetes. When the researchers matched patients with the work stress results, they found those who were under most pressure were 45 per cent more likely to have developed diabetes. The findings were published by the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.

Yoghurt 'may ward off diabetes'
Eating low-fat yoghurt may reduce your risk of developing type-2 diabetes by almost a third, a new study has shown. The University of Cambridge study, published in the journal Diabetologia, analysed food diaries kept by 4000 British men and women aged 45 to 74, including 753 who developed the disease during the following 11 years. Researchers divided participants into low, medium and high consumers of dairy, and they also analysed the type of dairy products consumed. They found that people who consumed the highest amount of low-fat yoghurt had a 28per cent reduced risk of developing type-2 diabetes compared with those who didn't consume the yoghurt. The group consumed an average of 4 125-gram pots of low-fat yoghurt a week. The researchers classified products containing less than 3.9per cent fat as low fat. High consumption of other low- fat fermented dairy products, including cottage cheese and fromage frais, was also associated with a reduced risk of developing the disease. The researchers did not find any link between the consumption of high-fat dairy or any kind of milk with the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. An endocrinologist at Melbourne's Austin Hospital, Richard O'Brien, said the study didn't prove eating low-fat fermented dairy products caused the lower risk, although there was a potential scientific basis for the link. He said it was possible that chemicals called menaquinones made by the fermentation process could protect against diabetes, and that probiotic bacteria contained in yoghurt could promote a healthy environment in the gut. Associate Professor O'Brien said it was important to note that the yoghurt eaters in the study tended to be slimmer, more active, and they smoked and drank less. ""The investigators used sophisticated computer modelling to try to control for all of those other factors, but this is always difficult,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, I believe these results are really important and... I'll certainly be recommending it [yoghurt] to my patients.""

Diabetes 'cure' for obese patients
Scientists have claimed the biggest step forward in diabetes treatment in 100 years after research found weight-loss surgery could ""cure"" the disease in around half of obese cases.
A coalition of 45 experts this week called for ""radical measures"" to address a growing pandemic.
Researchers said one million patients were sufficiently overweight to benefit from surgery, with around 100,000 people a year likely to become suitable candidates for the procedure.
New international guidelines say that patients with diabetes should be considered for such operations. Research shows that it achieves ""long-term remission"" in 30 per cent to 63 per cent of cases.
Professor Francesco Rubino, one of the team behind the guidelines and professor of metabolic and bariatric surgery at King's College London, said: ""This is the closest that we have ever been to a cure for diabetes. It is the most powerful treatment to date."" Britain is the second fattest nation in Europe, with two in three adults classed as overweight or obese.
In the past decade there has been a 65 per cent rise in diagnoses of diabetes, of which nine in 10 are type 2, which is linked with sedentary lifestyles and poor diet.
Professor Sir George Alberti, co- author of the guidelines, said: ""We are not talking about the treatment of obesity, we are talking about the treatment of diabetes.""
Researchers said the most effective type of surgery was a gastric bypass also known as stomach stapling, in which the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach. They said changing the anatomy altered the body's macrobiotic environment, which had a dramatic and almost immediate impact on blood sugar.
Professor Alberti said that although lifestyle changes - such as a very low calorie diet - could reverse diabetes, it was not realistic to expect most people to be able to do this.

Funding to help diabetics monitor condition
The fingertips of young Noah Davies are a mess, thanks to routine pinpricks to check his blood glucose levels. But that's about to change, now that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has pledged $54million funding for new technology that could end a ritual familiar to anyone with type 1 diabetes. The move has the backing of the Labor Party. The constant glucose monitor is a device that monitors blood sugar and transmits the results to a smartphone or an insulin pump. Noah's mother Megan, from Canberra, said her son was diagnosed with diabetes at 18 months and now wears an insulin pump. He's a candidate to receive one of the new devices. ""Instead of giving him a blood test, we'll be able to see if he is high or low and adjust accordingly,"" Ms Davies told reporters in Campbelltown, where Mr Turnbull was campaigning in the Liberal marginal seat of Macarthur. The $54million will subsidise the cost of devices for about 4000 young people aged up to 20. It was an announcement that played into Mr Turnbull's innovation message to Australians and how using the latest technology can help children live normal lives. ""It's really life-changing,"" he said. Health Minister Susan Ley said she received more letters about continuous glucose monitoring for diabetes than any other subject.

Like polio and smallpox before it, some diseases of today will be a distant memory for Australians in 50 years. Cervical cancer, type 1 diabetes and rheumatic fever are just some of the diseases WA experts are predicting could be on the eradicated list when our grandchildren are grown up.
The only disease ever completely wiped out is smallpox. One of the most devastating known to humanity, it was declared eradicated by the World Health Organisation in 1980.
Polio, too, is almost there, with 80 per cent of the world's population living in polio-free regions.
In Australia between the 1930s and 1960s, 40,000 cases of paralytic polio were recorded, however, a vaccination campaign that began in the 1950s worked to help Australia be finally declared polio free in 2000.
Grant Morahan, head of the Centre for Diabetes Research at the Harry Perkins Institute for Medical Research, said the most likely targets for eradication in the next generation would be those diseases that involved the immune system.
This included infectious diseases, because they could be eliminated by vaccine and also treated by antibiotics, but also autoimmune diseases, where the immune system, instead of protecting the body, actually contributed to disease.
Type 1 diabetes was a prime example, where the immune system attacked and killed the beta cells in the pancreas that produced insulin.
""In order for this disease to disappear from the population we need to find some way to control the immune system so it doesn't attack the beta cells,"" Professor Morahan said.
This was likely to be in the form of a vaccine that worked by reducing the auto-immune response particular to type 1 diabetes.
""We have known for 200 years how to boost the immune response to a particular agent but it is much more difficult to suppress a response to an agent.
""That is why so much work has been going on to try to find a way to do this.
""We are at the start of the path now - we can protect experimental animals from type 1 diabetes.""
Clinical trials are under way but it would be a year or two before it was known if those trials were successful.
""With this rate of progress, in 50 years' time, I would imagine type 1 diabetes would have been largely eradicated,"" Professor Morahan said.
""What researchers can do now would have seemed like science fiction 10 years ago, so it is not that unbelievable that what we are talking about could be accomplished in 50 years' time.""
This type of immune response-suppressing vaccine could also translate to breakthroughs for other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, he said.
The ability to predict which of those people diagnosed with melanoma were at higher risk of dying was also well advanced.
""So those people should go into an earlier or more-intensive treatment. Before this can be translated into practice more work needs to be done but in theory we could do that prediction today,"" Professor Morahan said.
Terry Slevin, from Cancer Council WA, was optimistic about substantial reductions in certain cancers, in particular cervical cancer given the vaccine for the human papilloma virus and lung cancer.
""A sensible prediction based on current evidence suggests that there will be a reduction in smoking-related cancers just given what we have witnessed with regard to a fall in smoking rates.
""The flow on impact from reduced smoking on cancer incidence will take a couple of decades."" Progress was being made on skin cancer, too.
The bowel cancer screening program would also save lives: over 40 years it was predicted 35,000 deaths could be prevented and even more if participation in screening increased.
""There are certainly reasons to be optimistic when it comes to progress in cancer control,"" Mr Slevin said.
In relation to heart disease, Heart Foundation WA president John O'Shea said it was tempting to think that rheumatic fever could be wiped out in Australia.
Rheumatic fever is caused by a streptococcus bacterium and leaves its mark by inflaming heart valves which cause problems later in life.
""With improved lifestyle and medical care and many other things we have seen this almost disappear but in the Third World it is still a frequent problem,"" Dr O'Shea said.
It was also still a big concern in indigenous people. ""(Heart valves) become thick and narrowed and leak in later life so by the time people are 40, 50, 60 they have a real problem with their heart valves. In the indigenous population this can happen earlier - in their 20 and 30s,"" he said.
Dr O'Shea said coronary artery disease remained common, however, the death rate had dropped off in the past 50 years thanks to plummeting smoking rates and effective medicines to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure. ""We are making quite a headway in terms of mortality for heart disease - the chances of a 65-year-old dying of a heart attack today are much less than they were for a 65-year- old in the 1960s.""

Paleo no magical cure for diabetes
DEVOTEES of the paleo diet shouldn't bank on it beating type 2 diabetes with a leading health researcher warning there is no evidence that eating like our ancestors ameliorates the medical condition.
Obesity is a major risk factor in developing type 2 diabetes and lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, are effective in reducing the risk of becoming insulin dependent.
While the cave man diet involves avoiding processed food and refined sugars, it also involves cutting out important sources of fibre and calcium, such as wholegrains and dairy.
Advocates of the diet, including chef Pete Evans, believe it is an effective way to reduce weight and gain glycaemic control, while some people even claim it can get them off their diabetes medication.
Associate Professor Sof Andrikopoulos, a researcher at the University of Melbourne Department of Medicine at Austin Hospital, reviewed all the scientific, peer-reviewed evidence on the diet and the condition.
Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia, he said the paleo diet advocates eating grass-fed meat, wild fish, fruit, vegetables, nuts and healthy fats.
While the focus on fresh foods and avoidance of processed foods appears consistent with dietary guidelines, Associate Professor Andrikopoulous said it was often skewed by individual interpretation with some people promoting a high intake of animal fats.
He found only 23 articles were written about the diet and type 2 diabetes with only three clinical trials conducted.
""The studies had fewer than 20 participants, one had no control diet and they were all 12 weeks or less so we can't draw any conclusions about the impact on weight gain or glycaemic control,"" he said.
""The scientific literature says that the paleo is no better than any other diet in limiting weight gain.
""In fact, the evidence is that there is no evidence that this diet is good for diabetics."" Diets promoted by celebrities that were high in fat and eliminated carbohydrates may actually lead to weight gain and increase the risk of heart disease, he said.

MEMO FOR MUMS TO BE Get moving to cut your baby's risk of diabetes 
IF you are overweight and pregnant, moderate exercise might cut the risk your baby will weigh more at birth and develop diabetes later.
A study of rats has found mothers who exercised moderately while pregnant reduced their offspring's weight, insulin and blood glucose levels.
However, male baby rats were more likely to benefit from their mothers' exercise than female babies, the University of NSW study has found.
The study, published in PLOS medicine, saw female rats fed a high-fat diet including pies, cakes, dim sims and biscuits for six weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy and the lactation period.
Half the rats undertook voluntary exercise in an exercise wheel in their cage from 10 days before mating and throughout the pregnancy while the others remained sedentary.
Babies born to the rats who exercised had smaller fat deposits around the abdomen and improved insulin and glucose metabolism.
Warradale mum Mary Miles is 26 weeks pregnant with her second child. Chasing after two-year-old Isla helps keep her slim, along with walking and eating well.

Diabetes epidemic in China to worsen
Beijing
China's diabetes epidemic is worse than previously estimated - much worse. The most comprehensive nationwide survey for diabetes in China shows 11.6per cent of adults, or 114million people, have the disease. The finding, published on Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, adds 22million diabetics to a 2007 estimate and means almost one in three of the world's diabetics is in China. Chinese are developing the metabolic disease at a lower body mass index than Americans, researchers found, meaning changes in diet and physical activity stoked by rapid economic development result in earlier onset of the obesity-linked disease. The epidemic will worsen, with 40 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds on the verge of developing diabetes, which increases risk of stroke, heart attack and kidney failure. ""Diabetes in China has become a catastrophe,"" said Paul Zimmet, honorary president of the International Diabetes Federation and director emeritus of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne. ""The booming economy in China has brought with it a medical problem which could bankrupt the health system."" The latest results mean diabetes is now more common in China than in the US, where 11.3per cent of adults are diabetic. The increase in diabetes prevalence in China, estimated at about 1per cent in 1980, has been ""unparalleled globally"", Mr Zimmet said. Authors led by Guang Ning, of the laboratory for endocrine and metabolic diseases at the National Health and Family Planning Commission, wrote: ""China is now among the countries with the highest diabetes prevalence in Asia and has the largest absolute disease burden of diabetes in the world. ""Poor nutrition in utero and early life combined with over- nutrition in later life may contribute to the accelerated epidemic.""

""I loved my carbs, so it was a bit of a challenge, but I had a big incentive to do it, being pregnant,"" she said.

""Exercise during pregnancy has also been associated with a lower risk of hypertension during pregnancy,"" she said.
Other research showed that in women who had developed gestational diabetes, breastfeeding for more than three months protected them against type 2 diabetes for up to 15 years after they gave birth. Bringing their weight into a healthy range before they get pregnant was also recommended.

Risky drinks Study links diabetes
THE risk of developing diabetes is significantly increased by consuming just one soft drink a day, a study has found.
People who consume diet drinks and pure fruit juice can breathe easily after the UK study found no clear link between those beverages and diabetes.
Previous North American studies have already found those who drink a sugar-sweetened beverage each day increase their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 25 per cent.
Researchers from London's Imperial College studied the soft drink consumption of 28,000 Europeans to see if the effect was replicated - and it was.
They compared 12,000 Europeans with type 2 diabetes and 16,000 random Europeans and found that drinking one 336ml sugary soft drink increased the risk of developing the disease by 22 per cent.
""Given the increase in sweet beverage consumption in Europe, clear messages on the unhealthy effect of these drinks should be given to the population,"" study author Dr Dora Romaguera said.
The research also found a statistical link between drinking artificially sweetened soft drinks and type 2 diabetes. The correlation disappeared with body weight taken into account.
The authors concluded the link was probably caused by the fact overweight people who were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, were also more likely to drink artificially sweetened drinks.
The researchers looked at the soft drink consumption of residents from the UK, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy and the Netherlands who are participating in a broader study into cancer and nutrition.

Strands of NBN improving indigenous lives
ASK Debbie Mundy what the National Broadband Network means to her and she'll tell you how the strands of fibre are life-changing.
A diabetic, Ms Mundy was one of 50 people to take part in an NBN telehealth trial for chronic diseases in Armidale, northern NSW.
With her blood sugar level in the high 20s, she didn't hesitate in participating after rave reviews from a friend.
Ms Mundy says the trial shows that blood sugar monitoring can be done successfully from the comfort of one's home - a boost for indigenous Australians like her.
It only takes a few minutes to get the readings, instead of having to travel far and wide to see a GP. And even then those appointments are hard to come by - a contrast for urban folk.
""Aboriginal people don't want to see a GP unless they really have to. You (city people) do take it for granted that you can get to see a doctor,"" Ms Mundy says.
""A lot of them don't bulk bill as well so it's hard for us as Aboriginal people and other people with not a lot of money (to see them).
""Out here, if you want to see a GP and if you don't have a family GP it could take a couple of weeks.""
According to an ABC Radio report, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are three times more likely as non-indigenous people to have diabetes. The death rate from diabetes among indigenous people is almost 12 times that of non-indigenous people.
As part of the trial, Ms Mundy's home was set up with an NBN connection from retail service provider SkyMesh.
Nurses with the telehealth trial, funded by the state and federal governments, set up the equipment at Ms Mundy's home.
She received a tablet computer, glucometer, a pulse oximeter (to monitor oxygen levels and heart rate) and blood pressure monitor.
""They (nurses) talk you through it... they tell you what to do and what equipment to use and set it up as a one-off,"" she says.
The readings are transmitted back to the telehealth hub, where nurses study Ms Mundy's readings. ""It's good because with my sugars I could see that it was sitting around the 27s and 23s and I knew that it was terribly high,"" says Ms Mundy, an Aboriginal liaison officer at a hospital in Armidale.
""That had been happening to me for a long time but because I wasn't monitoring it daily I couldn't see it there.""
Ms Mundy says the advice she has received on how to decrease her blood sugar levels has worked wonders. ""My sugar's down to 9 and I'm trying to get them under 7... I'll get there and I'm feeling heaps better and I've increased my exercises as well,"" she says.
""It's all due to support from the telehealth nurses.""
She says the NBN has ""really changed my life"", adding: ""Before, I'd get to lunchtime and want to get home, have a sleep. I'm now on insulin and that (advice) came out through the telehealth monitoring of my sugars.""
Ms Mundy has already spread the word to her community and wants everyone to know how beneficial the NBN is.
Armidale Community Health's Coralie Wales, who is the project leader, is pleased with the results of the trial, which she said had a large number of participants from the indigenous community.
Dr Wales said one in five people in Armidale was Aboriginal, and she wanted to engage the Aboriginal community to take part in more trials, such as a new cancer-related telehealth pilot.
""We're really trying to work with our Aboriginal community now for the best way to help feel comfortable about it because our project team needs to understand the experience of cancer for Aboriginal people,"" Dr Wales said.
""We already know that most families are really heavily impacted by cancer and it's really quite shocking.
""The problem is that by the time people are prepared to put their hand up they're often just so ill that they go into hospital and don't come out."" She said early intervention was key.
""We want people to stay healthy and if they do have symptoms to get really early help,"" Dr Wales said.
""That's what we're working with the Aboriginal community to achieve.""
A report on the chronic diseases trial is due in the next few months. Dr Wales hopes the processes can be implemented elsewhere so other patients can benefit from the NBN.

Beat diabetes without surgery, medication or exercise
Even after living with diabetes for six years, you can still beat it without surgery or medication and, initially, without exercise too.
So concludes a study on type 2 diabetes just published in the prestigious journal, The Lancet. It shows diabetes remission can be achieved with a radical diet.
This UK study is based on the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes is caused by excess fat within the liver and pancreas and those with the disease can be returned to normal glucose control by consuming a radically low calorie diet.
Whether this is practicable and can achieve remission of type 2 diabetes in the care of the family doctor, without any bariatric surgery, was not known until now. The study involved almost 300 adults who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the past six years. They were drawn from 49 family practices across Scotland and the Tyneside region of England.
Half were put on the radical weight management program while the other half followed standard treatment determined by diabetes guidelines. They were the control group.
After having their anti-diabetic and blood-pressure lowering drugs stopped, those on the radical program were subjected to an intense diet.
It began with a diet replacement phase. This consisted of a low calorie formula diet of about 850 calories a day for three to five months.
Food was then reintroduced in a stepped program for the next two to eight weeks, with ongoing support for weight-loss maintenance.
The participants, aged 20-65, received cognitive behavioural therapy combined with strategies to increase physical activity. They were aiming to shed 15kg or more, sufficient to achieve remission of diabetes.
After a year, they had lost an average of 10kg and nearly half had reverted to a non-diabetic state without using any diabetes treatment.
They did far better than participants in the control group who lost an average of 1kg and only 4 per cent of whom achieved a remission.
Remission was closely linked with the degree of weight loss.
The radical group also improved blood lipid concentrations and almost half remained off all blood pressure drugs with no rise in blood pressure.
They also reported substantially improved quality of life at 12 months while the control group reported a slight decrease.
Study co-author Professor Roy Taylor from Newcastle University said rather than addressing the root cause, standard treatment for type 2 diabetes mainly focuses on reducing blood sugar levels through drug treatments.
""Bariatric surgery can achieve remission of diabetes in about three-quarters of people, but it is more expensive and risky, and is only available to a small number of patients.""
The researchers say the challenge now is long-term avoidance of weight re-gain. They will follow the participants for the next four years.

For Pete's sake, this diet fad is making us fat
LIVING on a paleo diet could place people's health and waistlines at risk, according to new scientific research.
Following the caveman-style diet for just eight weeks can lead to rapid weight gain, health complications and an acceleration of pre-diabetes symptoms for those already overweight, a University of Melbourne study has found.
The results are so alarming, lead researcher Professor Sof Andrikopoulos has issued a warning over the diet popularised by celebrities including Pete Evans, left.
Results from animal tests originally intended to demonstrate the benefits of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet stunned the scientists when they resulted in a 15 per cent weight gain and rising insulin.
""If you are an individual with obesity and pre-diabetes, this type of diet would make you gain even further weight and push you into the diabetic range,"" Prof Andrikopoulos said.
""It actually accelerated the impact of pre-diabetes.
""It may not necessarily be a terrible diet for everybody, but in a certain proportion of the population this type of diet may be harmful.
""You need to speak to proper health professionals - speak to your GP, seek advice from a registered dietitian, get exercises advice - rather than listening to Pete Evans who says this is great."" The paleo diet favours heavy doses of meat, vegetables, eggs, nuts and fish, but outlaws grains, dairy, legumes, processed food and refined sugar.
During the study the University of Melbourne researchers placed one group of overweight mice on a paleo-style low-carb, high-fat diet, while another group of fat mice remained on their normal food.
Results published in the Nature journal Nutrition and Diabetes reveal that in eight weeks the weight of the paleo mice ballooned by 15 per cent and their fat mass doubled as their glucose intolerance worsened and insulin levels rose.
With the mouse and human genome being very similar, the researchers believe the results would be mirrored in overweight people.
""To put that in perspective, for a 100 kilogram person, that's the equivalent of 15 kilograms in two months. That's extreme weight gain,"" Assoc Prof Andrikopoulos said.
""You put an individual who is already not moving a lot on a low-carb, high fat diet and what happens is that they don't have the ability to burn the additional fat they are eating so they gain weight, and that is really bad."" While the paleo-style diet may benefit active and healthy people such as its celebrity proponents, Prof Andrikopoulos urged would-be dieters to seek professional advice better suited to individual needs.
ALL ABOUT THE PALEO WAY Also known as the caveman or hunter-and-gatherer diet, the paleo diet is based on the types of foods consumed by early humans and consists of meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, nuts and seeds.
The diet excludes dairy, cereal products and processed food. The focus of the diet is overall health rather than weight loss. The diet's philosophy is based on the belief that conditions such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease all started when humans embraced farming practices and cultivated food While the concept behind the paleo diet goes back tens of thousands of years, the idea of the Palaeolithic diet can be traced back to a 1975 book by gastroenterologist Dr Walter Voegtlin. It gained momentum in 2002 as a result of the book, The Paleo Diet, by exercise physiologist Dr Loren Cordain.

Chewing into fat of the land
LIFE choices can be costly and deadly. This is particularly true of poor diet, obesity and the epidemic that is Type II diabetes in Australia.
Today is Diabetes Day, and it is sobering to note that increasing numbers of younger Queenslanders are being diagnosed with what is largely a preventable condition.
Queensland's chief health officer estimates two-thirds of Queensland adults and one-quarter of children are overweight or obese. This excessive body fat and poor diet - combined with a lack of exercise - is the major contributing factor to Type II diabetes.
Lost productivity from diabetes will cost Australian taxpayers $3.4 billion in 2030. This includes $350 million in extra welfare payments, $166 million in uncollected taxation revenue, and $2.9 billion in lost gross domestic product.
And that is not counting the direct healthcare costs, which also run into the billions of dollars. Despite well-meaning pushes from health advocates though, nanny-state measures such as a tax on sugary drinks and restricting junk food advertising is not a lasting solution. The only thing that will work is education - and a lot more self-discipline from all of us.

Aussies sick and they don't know it
MILLIONS of Australians have heart disease and diabetes - but don't know it - the shock results of blood tests taken in a national health survey show.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics uncovered Australia's hidden disease problems when it tested blood and urine samples from 11,000 people taking part in its regular health survey.
The results were a surprise for participants and health practitioners, uncovering serious undiagnosed health problems.
One in three Australians in the survey were found to have high cholesterol but only one in 10 knew it.
The results of the blood tests showed three in four Australians aged over 45 had risk factors for heart disease and nearly half those aged 18- 45 had at least one risk factor for heart disease. Almost one million Australians have been told they have diabetes but the survey found 231,000 have the disease but don't know it.

Caesareans, diabetes on the rise for new mothers
More women are being diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy and more are having births induced or delivered by caesarean, new figures show.
While the average new mother is older than in the past, the proportion of teen pregnancies is falling. Most women who had babies last year (35.3 per cent) were aged between 30 and 34. The number aged over 45 rose from 224 in 2011 to 268 last year.
The Mothers and Babies 2015 report released by the NSW government on Sunday shows the reported rate of gestational diabetes rose from 6.4 per cent in 2011 to 8.3 per cent in 2015. The rate of diabetes mellitus also increased from 0.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent over the same five-year period.
The rate of spontaneous labour fell from 39.4 per cent in 2011 to 36 per cent in 2015 and the rate of induction of labour rose from 26.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent.
Diabetes was among the most common reasons for induced labour in 2015.
Professor Jonathan Morris, who sits on the NSW Health maternal and perinatal advisory committee, said the increase in women with diabetes in pregnancy was related to changes in guidelines for diagnosis and increased screening. The blood sugar level required for a diagnosis of gestational diabetes is now lower than it was in 2011.
""That's the main explanation, but some of the risk factors for gestational diabetes such as older age and increased [Body Mass Index] are increasing as well,"" he said.
The rate of normal vaginal births fell from 56.9 to 56 per cent, while the caesarean section rate increased from 31.3 per cent to 32.4 per cent.
Mothers with private health insurance were more likely to have caesareans. Their rate of normal vaginal birth fell from 44.9 per cent in 2011 to 43.6 per cent in 2015 and the caesarean section rate increased from 40.4 to 43 per cent.
Among publicly insured mothers the rate of normal vaginal birth fell from 63.3 to 62.3 per cent and the caesarean section rate rose from 26.5 to 27.3 per cent.
The number of births overall in NSW fell from 97,245 in 2011 to 96,391 in 2015 - a decrease of 0.9 per cent.
The largest increase was in the South Western Sydney Local Health District, from 12,831 to 13,214 between 2011 and 2015.
The largest decrease was in the Hunter New England Local Health District, from 11,290 to 10,947.
The percentage of mothers born in Australia decreased between 2011 and 2015, from 66.4 to 64 per cent. In 2015, mothers born in India, China, New Zealand, Britain, the Philippines, Vietnam, Lebanon and Iraq together accounted for 17.5 per cent of all mothers.
Health Minister Jillian Skinner said she was ""encouraged"" the number of women smoking during their pregnancies had dropped.

Diabetes protein insight
RESEARCHERS have discovered a protein that if blocked could help prevent overweight Australians from developing Type 2 diabetes.
""One of the first thing that happens to many people when they become obese is that they get a fatty liver, which precedes Type 2 diabetes,"" Monash University Physiology Professor Matthew Watt said.
Researchers at the university's School of Biomedical Sciences studied obese mice and found their fatty livers secreted a different subset of proteins from normal livers.
Prof Watt said they also found this set of proteins caused insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
They singled out one of these proteins as being particularly important in insulin resistance in mice. It was the first time the protein was shown to lead to insulin resistance.
Prof Watt said it was not a cure for Type 2 diabetes but, if it could be blocked, it may improve insulin resistance.
The next step is to work out whether blocking the protein in mice could improve the insulin sensitivity. ""This could reduce the risk of developing Type 2 by reducing insulin resistance."" he said.

Seminar puts diabetes research in spotlight
Local scientists whose research is helping to make great steps towards better treatments and tests for type 1 and 2 diabetes globally will discuss their latest findings at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research next month.
The seminar will look at projects such as islet cell development and the creation of a test that could predict a person's chance of developing type 1 diabetes, as well as a person's risk of developing particular diabetic complications.
It will be presented by Professor Grant Morahan, the director of the Centre for Diabetes Research at the institute.
It is estimated 280 Australians develop diabetes every day and, even more alarmingly, experts predict 3.3 million Australians will have type 2 diabetes by 2031.
The seminar, called Local Researchers Changing Lives, is on Thursday, July 10, at 10am at the QEII Medical Centre in Nedlands.
Among the research by the Perkins diabetes group has been the identification of genes affecting each form of diabetes in both humans and mice. They are now investigating ways to restore the ability to produce insulin by developing stem cell treatments.
The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is not yet known, although much research is underway into this. It normally occurs in young people and is caused when cells in the pancreas that produce insulin have been destroyed. It has a strong family link and cannot be prevented. It is typically treated with insulin injections and, unlike type 2 diabetes, it has nothing to do with lifestyle.
Type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or at least delayed, by maintaining a healthy weight and is treated with a balanced diet and/or insulin injections or tablets. It occurs when the body no longer reacts to its own insulin or stops producing enough of the hormone.

Low-fat yoghurt in diet may help keep diabetes at bay
Consuming low-fat yoghurt may reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by almost a third, a new study has shown.
The Cambridge University study, published in the journal Diabetologia, analysed seven-day food diaries kept by 4000 British men and women aged 45 to 74 years, including 753 who developed type-2 diabetes over the following 11 years.
Researchers divided participants into low, medium and high consumers of dairy and also analysed the type of dairy products they were consuming.
They found that people who consumed the highest amount of low-fat yoghurt had a 28 per cent reduced risk of developing diabetes compared with people who did not eat low-fat yoghurt.
The group consumed an average of 4? 125-gram pots of low-fat yoghurt a week. The researchers classified products containing less than 3.9 per cent fat as low-fat.
High consumption of other low-fat fermented dairy products including cottage cheese and fromage frais was also associated with a reduced risk of developing type-2 diabetes.
The researchers did not find any association between total or high-fat dairy consumption, or consumption of any kind of milk, and the risk of developing type-2 diabetes.
Austin Hospital endocrinologist Richard O'Brien said the study did not prove that eating low-fat fermented dairy products caused the reduced diabetes risk, although there was a potential scientific basis for the link.
He said it was possible that chemicals called menaquinones made by the fermentation process could protect against diabetes, and that probiotic bacteria contained in yoghurt could promote a healthy environment in the gut.
Associate Professor O'Brien said it was important to note that the yoghurt eaters in the study tended to be slimmer, more physically active, and to smoke and drink less so were a healthier group overall.
""The investigators used sophisticated computer modelling to try and control for all of those other factors, but this is always difficult,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, I believe these results are really important as they build on what we know from previous studies. I already eat yoghurt regularly and I'll certainly be recommending it to my patients from now on.""
La Trobe University dietitian Audrey Tierney said the main message was ""to look at the net effect of whole foods, dietary patterns and healthy lifestyle factors and not only isolated foods, nutrients or behaviours"".
Dr Tierney said people eating low-fat yoghurt should make sure the fat had not been replaced with high amounts of sugar. Australian dietary guidelines recommended foods containing less than 10 grams of sugar per 100 grams.

Free kits ease night fears for diabetics 
Parents will no longer have to worry about their diabetic kids dying during the night with the Federal Government today announcing free continuous glucose monitoring kits for children and teenagers.
The $54 million program will provide eligible families with a sticker to place on the skin of children who have diabetes to estimate blood glucose levels.
Alerts will be sent to parents' smartphones when their child's glucose levels become concerning, allowing them to administer insulin immediately.
Continuous glucose monitoring kits cost up to $4000 a year but from tomorrow will be available free for eligible families.
There are 15,000 children and teenagers with type 1 diabetes in Australia. It is estimated that about 4000 people will access the program. Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease that attacks a person's ability to produce insulin. Children and young people with the disease have to monitor their glucose levels around the clock.
It is estimated that about 10 Australians with type 1 diabetes die each year overnight because of complications relating to their disease.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said continuous glucose monitoring would save lives and also reduce the hassle of the daily finger prick for diabetics.
""While the finger-prick method is effective and accurate, it can be quite a difficult and upsetting process for some children and their parents, with up to 10 tests needed every day - including several times every night,"" Mr Hunt said.
Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said today's announcement would massively ease the burden for families with children suffering from type 1 diabetes.
""It is hard to overstate the significance of this,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It will literally change lives and save lives in thousands of Australian families where children and young people have type 1 diabetes.""
Mr Johnson said for parents, the burden of having a young child with type 1 diabetes was enormous and many didn't sleep well at night for fear their children would suffer hypoglycaemia - dangerously low blood glucose that can lead to unconsciousness or even death.
""We have parents telling us that they haven't slept for 10 years because they lie awake every night worrying if their child would have hypoglycaemia and lose consciousness,"" he said.
Parents who think their children will benefit from a continuous glucose monitoring kit should consult with an authorised health professional who will assess their need.

Kidney hope
A NEW drug, promising to stop the major cause of chronic kidney failure in its tracks and save patients around the world needing transplants or a life on dialysis, has been developed by Melbourne scientists.
In a world-first study a team from Monash University and Monash Health has been able to not only halt the progression of diabetic kidney disease, but even reverse some of its damage.
With current treatments only able to delay the need for dialysis or a transplant by slowing the onset of the disease, the breakthrough could have widespread ramifications for millions of diabetics.
Following the success of the Melbourne research in animals, biotech company Gilead Sciences is now adapting its drug to a clinical trial in 300 US patients, although it will be at least two years before the full results are known.
Rather than target the actual diabetes, the new drug - known as GS-444217 - works by blocking a chemical reaction the disease usually triggers that causes inflammation and scarring in a person's kidneys.
Lead researcher Dr Greg Tesch said the stress of diabetes usually switched on an enzyme called ASK1, however the new drug inhibited the enzyme and stopped the signal to continue damaging the kidneys and possibly other organs.
""Even when the disease is quite well established our work has shown we can block any further progression of the disease,"" Dr Tesch said.
""Diabetic kidney disease is the major single cause of progression to end stage renal failure around the world, so this is very promising."" The findings are in Diabetes.

Research raises hope of reversing Type 2 diabetes 
Drastic diet changes may help overcome Type 2 diabetes for some.
Many experts believe Type 2 diabetes is an incurable disease that gets worse with time. But new research raises the tantalising possibility that drastic changes in diet may reverse the disease in some people. Recently, a small clinical trial in England studied the effects of a strict liquid diet on 30 people who had lived with Type 2 diabetes for up to 23 years. Nearly half of those studied had a remission that lasted six months after the diet was over. While the study was small, the finding offers hope to millions who have been told they must live with the intractable disease. ""This is a radical change in our understanding of Type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr Roy Taylor, a professor at Newcastle University in England and the study's senior author. ""If we can get across the message that 'Yes, this is a reversible disease - that you will have no more diabetes medications, no more sitting in doctors' rooms, no more excess health charges' - that is enormously motivating."" It is not the first time that people have reversed Type 2 diabetes by losing a lot of weight shortly after a diagnosis. Studies have also shown that obese individuals who have bariatric surgery frequently see the condition vanish even before they lose very much weight. But the new study, published in Diabetes Care, proved the reversal after diet can persist for at least half a year as long as patients keep weight off, and can occur in people who have had the disease for many years. The researchers followed the participants after they had completed an eight-week, low-calorie- milkshake diet and returned to normal eating. Six months later, those who had gone into remission immediately after the diet were still diabetes-free. Though most of those who reversed the disease had had it for less than four years, some had been diabetic for more than eight years. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body cannot use insulin properly or make enough insulin, so the body cannot properly use or store glucose (a form of sugar) and sugar backs up into the bloodstream, raising blood sugar levels. Although no one knows exactly why the diet appeared to reverse diabetes, Taylor said it might be related to how the body stores fat.
Excess fat in the liver can spill into the pancreas, inhibiting insulin secretion and the liver's response to insulin, resulting in insulin resistance and diabetes. Going on a very low-calorie diet may allow the body to use up fat from the liver, causing fat levels to drop in the pancreas as well. That ""wakes up"" the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, normalising blood glucose levels. The participants in the Newcastle trial, who ranged from overweight to extremely obese, were told to stop their diabetes medications and start a 600- to 700-calorie-a-day diet, consisting of three diet milkshakes a day at mealtimes and half a pound of nonstarchy vegetables a day. The people in the study most likely to respond to the treatment were in their early 50s on average and younger than the nonresponders, and they had had diabetes for fewer years. The responders were also healthier before the trial: they had been taking fewer medications, had lower fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, and had higher baseline serum insulin levels. Three of those who went into remission had lived with diabetes for more than eight years. Many of the responders are still in the prediabetes zone and at risk for developing diabetes, Taylor said. ""It's not fair to say they were completely normalised, but they're at a level of blood sugar where we don't expect to see the serious complications associated with diabetes. That's why it's such good news.""

Glucose monitors give peace of mind
There are two types of diabetes and both are becoming more prevalent. About 1.7 million Australians now have diabetes and every day another 280 develop the condition, where their bodies cannot regulate the amount of glucose in their blood. Type 1 diabetes, usually diagnosed in children after a rapid onset of symptoms, accounts for 10 per cent of cases and type 2 accounts for 85 per cent of cases, and is increasing rapidly. Type 2 diabetes has become something of a tragic marker of a society that is getting fatter, less active, more sedentary. It is preventable.
Your weight, and where you carry it, is a factor in developing type 2 diabetes but there are others.
According to Diabetes Australia, which has a risk calculator on its website, there is increased risk if you: have a family history of diabetes; are over 55; are over 45 and overweight; are over 45 and have high blood pressure; are over 35 and are from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background; are over 35 and are from a Pacific island, Indian subcontinent or Chinese cultural background; are a woman who has given birth to a child over 4.5kg, or had gestational diabetes when pregnant, or had a condition known as polycystic ovarian syndrome.
A recent study from the University of Queensland also highlights the potential added risks for older women taking cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins.
Mark Jones from the UQ school of public health says women over 75 face a 33 per cent higher chance of developing diabetes if they are on statins. ""We found that almost 50 per cent of women in their late 70s and 80s in the study took statins, and 5 per cent were diagnosed with new-onset diabetes,"" Jones says.
From this month, free continuous glucose monitoring devices are being made available to eligible children and people under the age of 21 with type 1 diabetes.
Health Minister Greg Hunt says the devices, which are wearable and sound the alarm if blood glucose levels become a problem, will be available through the National Diabetes Services Scheme, saving around $4000 a year.
""While the finger-prick method is effective and accurate, it can be quite a difficult and upsetting process for some children and their parents, with up to 10 tests needed every day, including several times every night,"" Hunt says.
Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson says the devices will help prevent or reduce the impact of hypoglycaemia and fear of the condition. ""Often parents simply don't sleep at night because of their fear that their child will go low with a 'hypo' and not wake up,"" he says.
""The peace of mind it will give children, young people and their parents is life-changing."" Diabetes Australia is one of 10 health organisations that this month called for the introduction of a sugar tax.
""Research has found that a sugar drinks levy could help reduce consumption by more than 10 per cent,"" says Johnson. ""Over 25 years, a tax on sugary drinks could mean 16,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes, 4400 fewer cases of heart disease and 1100 fewer cases of stroke.
""Anything that makes sugary drinks less appealing and encourages Australians to consume less of them, and more of healthy alternatives like water, is a step in the right direction."" It is not a step the Turnbull government is likely to take. Despite the potential $500 million annual budget boost from a sugar tax, Hunt says the government will stick with existing health initiatives, noting that fresh fruit and vegetables are GST-free, unlike soft drinks.
Today is World Health Day, and the focus this year is depression. People with diabetes are two to three times more likely to be diagnosed with depression. A study by Jane Speight of the Australian Centre for Behavioural Research in Diabetes found 36 per cent of people with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, 21 per cent of people with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and 24 per cent of people with type 1 diabetes experience depressive symptoms.

Sleep problems have been linked to a new risk, with researchers warning that getting too little or too much sleep increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.
WA's peak diabetes funding group said research suggested people who had trouble sleeping faced an increased risk of type 2 diabetes because they developed insulin resistance.
A study this week found that men who slept too much or too little were more likely to have an impaired ability to process sugar, compared with men who slept an average amount - about seven hours.
Speaking before Sleep Awareness Week and National Diabetes Week, Diabetes Research WA said the link between sleeping issues and diabetes needed further study. Director Sherl Westlund said a Harvard study this year showed that women with sleep concerns were at significantly greater risk of type 2 diabetes.

Gestational diabetes battle
Fiona Stanley Hospital has a clinic devoted to reducing the risk of complications, writes STEPHANIE PEGLER
Pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes can now attend a clinic at Fiona Stanley Hospital specially designed to address the problem.
The Diabetes in Pregnancy Service, which opened in February, focuses on those women who are unable to control their blood glucose levels through dietary modification and need insulin treatment.
Endocrinologist Emily Gianatti said about one in seven pregnant women would develop gestational diabetes and they needed increased monitoring to reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy and birth.
""For women who have required insulin treatment for gestational diabetes in the past, they needed to go to King Edward Memorial Hospital (in Subiaco) to receive optimal care,"" she said. ""For a lot of women, this meant travelling quite a distance and having their babies there, a long way from home, their family and their support network.
""For the first time we are able to provide this complex care outside of King Edward.""
The team at the new Murdoch hospital includes endocrinologists, obstetricians, midwives, diabetes nurse educators, dietitians and lactation consultants, enabling patients to get both antenatal and diabetes care at the same place.
""By providing this care in a multi-disciplinary clinic, they get to see all of us at the one appointment rather than needing to come in multiple times for multiple appointments,"" Dr Gianatti said.
About 230 women with gestational diabetes had their babies at Fiona Stanley in the first six months of operation - of those about 35 required insulin treatment.
Dr Gianatti said that not only was gestational diabetes on the rise, the number of women needing insulin was also increasing. This was because of a number of factors, including the surge in obesity rates and women having babies later in life.
Baldivis mother Dawn Harborow, whose baby Phoebe was born last month, can't speak highly enough of the clinic and its team.
Her diagnosis of gestational diabetes came from a blood test at 26 weeks, after she was referred to the hospital with an incompetent cervix. She said she was considered a risk for gestational diabetes because polycystic ovarian syndrome had made her insulin-resistant.
Her fasting levels were not being controlled properly so she had to give herself a long-acting insulin injection each night.
Mrs Harborow visited the clinic for check-ups every fortnight as well as attending some group education sessions.
""It wasn't great getting diabetes but I couldn't have been in better hands,"" she said.
""The care that you get is a lot more hands-on, you are watched a lot more carefully. You are monitored not just for the diabetes but you have more scans.
""I am glad that it was recognised so that (my baby) wasn't affected by the sugars.""
Dr Gianatti stressed the importance of women having the blood test to check for gestational diabetes, saying there was an increasing misconception that the condition wasn't a big deal so women avoided the test.
Gestational diabetes increases the risk of pre-eclampsia, premature birth and stillbirth.
It can also cause a baby to grow larger, making an instrumental or surgical intervention more likely during delivery.
Newborns may also need intensive-care treatment for low blood-sugar levels and breathing difficulties.
""Successful treatment with diet and insulin reduces these adverse outcomes,"" Dr Gianatti said. ""A diagnosis can make a big difference.""
'It wasn't great getting the diabetes but I couldn't have been in better hands. I am glad that it was recognised so that (my baby) wasn't affected by the sugars.'

All pregnant women should be tested for gestational diabetes during the second trimester by taking a blood test before and after a glucose drink. You are more at risk if you:
Are over 25
Have a family history of type 2 diabetes
Are overweight
Are from an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, Polynesian, Asian or Middle Eastern background
Had the condition in previous pregnancies
Have had polycystic ovarian syndrome
SOURCE: DIABETES AUSTRALIA What is it?
Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy when the body cannot cope with the extra demand for insulin production, resulting in high blood glucose levels.
The condition is managed by monitoring blood glucose levels, adopting a healthy diet and exercise plan and, for some, insulin injections.
After the baby is born, gestational diabetes usually disappears. But these women then have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Health wrap diabetes Hames
A few years ago, I was asked to consider allocating State Government land for a family- oriented centre that would look at how the complex and challenging childhood disease known as type 1 diabetes could be treated.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that typically affects people under 30 years but can occur at any age. It is a condition where the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin because of a range of complex deficiencies in the immune system.
As with many such conditions, it has an impact on all members of the family, not only the child diagnosed. The centre therefore serves variously as a meeting place, education space, diabetes clinic, play area and chill-out zone.
Now in 2015, situated on land provided by the State Government adjacent to the Osborne Park Hospital, the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre is establishing a reputation for excellence.
The centre is a first of its kind in Australia and offers children and their families the information, care and resources to face the challenges of type 1 diabetes with confidence.
On behalf of the State Government, I am very proud to see the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre develop into such a leading initiative and to see the contribution of land and $1.4 million in Lotterywest grants put to such worthwhile use.

Happy pills raise chance of diabetes
ANTI-DEPRESSANTS taken by hundreds of thousands of people may increase the chances of developing diabetes, researchers warn.
A major British study involving more than a million patients has shown that those taking all anti-depressant pills are at far higher risk from the condition.
Academics from Southampton University think this may be because anti-depressants cause weight gain, which in turn leads to type-2 diabetes.
But despite the strong link, they cannot be sure that the pills are causing the condition.
The study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, found many patients were developing type 2 diabetes - the commonest form - after they had been prescribed antidepressants, which suggests the pills cause the illness.
Experts say doctors are handing out the pills too freely without considering the possible long-term side effects. The study was one of the largest of its kind and looked at 25 research papers to reach the finding.

Quest to treat diabetes-related foot disease
Liverpool Hospital podiatrist Dr Matthew Malone says research he's undertaking is indicating about 60 per cent of patients who present at Liverpool with major foot problems haven't sought prior medical treatment, which partly explains why Malone vividly remembers so many cases.
One patient who arrived at the clinic three weeks after her initial discharge for toe amputation typifies the types of scenarios Malone regularly encounters. She presented with sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection, he says.
""She's had a procedure and not bothered to see anybody after that. We have to rush her down with the medico to the emergency department and the next thing you know, she's in hospital having intravenous antibiotics and we're trying to stabilise her because she's very unwell.""
Malone is the head of department, podiatric medicine at Liverpool Hospital, which is a leading provider of treatment for people with foot problems. Clinic staff see about 350 patients a month, for issues ranging from foot ulcers to infections that require leg amputations.
Malone is also a senior member of not-for-profit medical research organisation the Ingham Institute's newly formed diabetes research group, based at the hospital.
He's working on research projects to determine how to improve clinical outcomes for patients with diabetes-related foot disease. In Australia, the incidence of people losing a leg because of diabetes is one of the highest in the developed world.
""We're basically trying to prevent them from coming into hospital and losing legs,"" he says.
Malone began his podiatry career in 2003. He completed a bachelor of science (podiatric medicine) at the University of Salford (UK) in 2003 and a master of science (podiatric medicine) at the University of Huddersfield in 2011. Recently, he became just the third-ever Australian to receive a fellowship from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow, on the basis of a strong track record in academic publishing, leadership in high-end research and exceptional clinical skills.
At present beginning a PhD, he intends to consolidate the link between the clinical and academic aspects of his role in the next five years. ""I see patients and have hands-on time with them and look at new treatment strategies designed to use on patients to better their outcomes in life. So a good mix of a clinical and academic role and working my way up to being a potential professor is where I see myself in the next five years.""

Pace quickens over diabetes 
Health - Mesoblast trials promising
Promising research data will prompt Australian-based regenerative medicine company Mesoblast to expedite a new round of more advanced clinical trials for a potential treatment for complications arising from diabetes.
""We couldn't have hoped for a better outcome,"" Mesoblast founder Professor Silviu Itescu said of the trial results.
""We met the primary end point"" of the research program.
Mesoblast said a phase II clinical trial of patients with diabetic nephropathy involving a single injection of its MPC-300-IV, an allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cell, was not only safe but reduced damaging inflammation and helped preserve or improve renal function of the kidney over at least a 24-week period.
""The numbers were quite substantial,"" Professor Itescu said of the research results.
""We 're looking at ways to accelerate the research program,"" he said, with trials across a larger patient base to validate the results.
""We can now target the sickest portion of the population.""
Diabetic nephropathy affects as many as half of all patients with type-2 diabetes, with a progressive decline in kidney function, which is resulting in a steep rise in the demand for kidney dialysis.
""There has been a fivefold increase in the numbers on dialysis in Australia since the late 1990s,"" Professor Itescu said.
""It is an exploding epidemic. Diabetic kidney disease is the No. 1 cause of end-state renal failure - it occurs in as many as 50 per cent of all cases. Drugs can control the disease but more than 40 per cent of those with diabetes end up with kidney failure.""
Existing treatments cannot address the renal failure, which has prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to encourage any treatment which can help to slow the decline in renal failure.
In its research trial, 30 patients were evaluated in a double-blind, random, placebo-controlled dose escalating trial, receiving a dose of Mesoblast's MPC-300-IV candidate.
Along with safety, the trial was aimed at demonstrating the effect of the MPC treatment in improving renal function. The research trial demonstrated safety as well as improved renal function.
""The results show that Mesoblast's allogeneic cell therapy was safe and may be particularly useful in patients with moderate to severe diabetic nephropathy, a disease which, despite all existing therapies, continues to have a high rate of progression to dialysis or transplantation, and to portent a high risk of death from cardiovascular disease,"" the trial's lead investigator, clinical associate professor David Packham, of the University of Melbourne's Department of Medicine, said. He is also director of the Melbourne Renal Research Group.
In the US alone, there are more than 20 million sufferers of diabetes, of which more than 6 million new patients are expected to develop diabetic nephropathy. Because of a shortage of kidneys, it is estimated more than 90,000 people died while waiting for transplants in the US in 2012, while 40 per cent of those on dialysis die within two years.

Type 2 diabetes a risk for young people, too
HEALTH I WROTE recently about epigenetics and the influence of each parent's health at the time of conception on, as it were, unlocking the potential in their child for any genetic risk.
The more of our population that is overweight and obese, the more likely type 2 diabetes will occur in their offspring. Some women develop type 2 diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes) and that child also carries an increased risk.
In recent years in my practice, more of our younger patients have been screened for diabetes because we know they have a family history. Now we have patients in their 20s who have tested positive, not just for impaired glucose tolerance (pre-diabetes) but diagnosed with type 2.
Statistics show cases are increasing, with a recent national health survey finding that a million Australians (4.4 per cent) have type 2 diabetes, up from 840,000 people (3.8 per cent) in three years. For patients with type 2 diabetes there are increased risks of blood vessel disease in the legs (peripheral vascular disease), heart attack and loss of sensation in the feet (peripheral neuropathy), all with potential to reduce life expectancy.
It is very confronting for an apparently healthy young person to face the prospect of lifelong medication. This is why the medical profession is so concerned about rising levels of excess weight and obesity in our community as it influences the risk of type 2 diabetes.
We now know more about how complex the drivers are for people gaining weight and maintaining excess weight. It is too simplistic to say, ""Eat less and exercise more,"" when there are so many environmental influences, as well as genetic drivers. We live in a world where opportunistic exercise is more difficult - children being driven to school rather than walking, overcrowded school curricula with less time for outdoor activity, increased screen time, poor food choices marketed as healthy options, and readily available, cheap, processed fast food.
GPs are aware of how sensitive the issue of healthy weight is for many patients, and know we could be accused of ""fat blaming"". This is not what we are doing - we are trying to educate our patients and promote better health.
However, governments have a major role to play in education and interventions that allow parents and expectant parents to understand appropriate eating and activity for their children.
Introducing a ""sugar tax"" or meaningful ""traffic light"" food labelling are steps governments could consider. Also, kindergartens, schools and communities must be well-resourced for outdoor play and physical activity so being active and eating well are the norm.

Are you on the road to diabetes?
Diabetes is the fastest-growing chronic health problem plaguing Aussies, yet many of us wouldn't know how to spot if we were at risk of the deadly disease, discovers Rosie King One Australian is diagnosed with diabetes every five minutes. Of those, 85-95 per cent will be diagnosed with type 2, a condition that's both deadly and preventable.
Sof Andrikopoulos, CEO of the Australian Diabetes Society, describes type 1 and type 2 diabetes as diseases of the pancreas, in which the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin to regulate the glucose levels in our blood.
""With type 1, the immune system actually kills the cells that produce insulin so there's a complete deficiency. With type 2, the insulin-producing cells don't work efficiently so there's a relative deficiency."" Type 2 used to typically affect men and women who were over 55. That's all changed now, Andrikopoulos says: ""When I started in diabetes research 25 years ago, you had to be over 55 to get type 2 but now we're seeing it in young adults, adolescents and even in children under 10. It all comes down to our lifestyle - the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are obese."" To stop type 2 diabetes taking hold, be aware of signs that might indicate a fast-track to diagnosis. Left undiagnosed and untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to illness, amputation, even death.
SIGNS YOU'RE AT RISK If any of these ring true, now's the time to act. Talk to your GP or health care professional EXPANDING WAISTLINE ""Waist circumference is strongly linked with diabetes risk,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If you're a man and your waistline is 102cm or above or you're a woman with a waist circumference of 88cm or higher, that's a very telling sign you could be heading down the path towards diabetes.
""Measuring your waist is easy, too. Just grab a measuring tape and wrap it around your belly. If it measures more than it should, it's a good idea to see someone about managing your weight, because as well as diabetes, you could be at risk of developing heart disease."" BAD DIET ""A poor diet will accelerate your progression to type 2 diabetes but little tweaks can go a long way,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""Cutting down the number of sugary drinks you have or how many sugars you put in your coffee every day can mean a big reduction in your discretionary kilojoule intake. Over six months, the benefits of that are huge."" It's a case of minimising the amount of treat foods you have now, so that you don't have to give them up forever.
""Once you've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, diet is critical to managing it properly,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""That means saying goodbye to all excessive kilojoules - the burgers, the pizza, the soft drinks. It all has to go."" It's not just about avoiding certain foods, it's also a matter of eating enough fruit, veg, nuts, wholegrains and fish, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE ""Just as exercise improves insulin resistance, a lack of activity makes it harder for those insulin-producing cells to do their job, which accelerates the development of diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""You don't have to run a marathon or lift 100kg at the gym every day but you do need to move regularly. Walking for 30 minutes every day is a cheap and easy way to give your body what it needs and minimise the risk.""
FAMILY HISTORY ""If one of your parents has type 2 diabetes, your likelihood of developing it rises by 30 per cent,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If both parents have type 2 diabetes, that number jumps to 70 per cent. We can't control our genes or our parents but we can control other risk factors. ""If you have a family history of diabetes, be vigilant about being active, ensure your weight is in a healthy range, don't smoke and don't drink excessively. That's my advice to anyone, regardless of their history.""
FREQUENT TOILET VISITS ""Going to the toilet more than twice a night is a reasonably good indicator of type 2 diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""Once your glucose levels reach a certain concentration in your blood, your kidneys start excreting the glucose in your urine so you'll need to go more often.""
EXCESSIVE THIRST ""If you're going to the toilet a lot, you're losing a significant amount of water in your urine, which leads to excessive thirst,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""But that doesn't have to be the case. Too much glucose in the blood can also flick the thirst switch in the brain so you'll continuously feel as though you need to be glugging down glasses of water.""
SENSITIVE SKIN ""When glucose levels are too high, our infection-fighting white blood cells don't work properly so skin irritations can be slow to heal,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""You might notice a rash that's hard to get rid of or a wound that takes an unusually long time to heal. This shows your immune system is weak, which could mean your diabetes risk is elevated.""
BLURRED VISION AND NUMBNESS ""I'd expect you to have every other symptom as well because if it's come to the stage of blurred vision and numb fingertips, you have out-of-control diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""Put the newspaper down and get to your doctor quick-smart.""
What about fatigue?
""Fatigue is a big but difficult one,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""With diabetes, your cells aren't working effectively or efficiently to secrete enough insulin, which can wreak havoc on your immune system and energy levels. It can be difficult to know what's causing a person's fatigue because it's a symptom of so many medical conditions - and our busy lives - but it's something to be mindful of if you're concerned about diabetes.""

A study will use probiotics to fight gestational diabetes
HAYLEY Leuken's pregnancies couldn't have been more different.
The mother of two lost weight while carrying her daughter Anabella eight years ago, but gained more than 30kg before giving birth to her son Jhett in March.
Along with the excess kilos came a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, leaving her so exhausted during the final three months of her pregnancy with Jhett that she spent a large part of her days in bed.
Jhett needed time in a special care nursery following his birth, a legacy of his mother's abnormal blood glucose levels. It's a scenario Leuken is determined to avoid next time.
""I couldn't think of anything worse than having gestational diabetes again,"" she says.
""It was really, really hard.
""Not to have your baby with you straightaway after the birth, that was just heart-breaking.""
Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital obstetric physician Leonie Callaway has launched a study of about 540 pregnant women to test whether taking probiotics - introducing ""good bacteria"" into their small intestines - can reduce their chances of developing gestational diabetes.
Associate Professor Callaway (below right) says the research follows a Finnish study of 250 women of normal weight that found a special probiotic formula cut their risk of gestational diabetes by about half.
She's been granted more than $800,000 from the National Health and Medical Research Council to test whether the same probiotic formula reduces gestational diabetes rates in women most at risk - those who are overweight or obese.
Callaway says half the women in the study will be randomly assigned to receive a daily capsule containing a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12. The remainder will be given a placebo. All participants will be advised about healthy eating.
""If this works, that means we need to really challenge our thinking about the pathology of gestational diabetes,"" she says.
""We've always thought it was mostly about the food you eat and how little exercise you do.
""But there may be a whole third world of why women get diabetes in pregnancy that relates to bacteria in the gut.
""It seems to be that the whole living organism that's inside us is way more important than we ever gave it credit for.
""The bugs that we have in our gut may actually influence the levels of sugar in our blood.""
Callaway says if the probiotic formula works, the benefits are potentially ""massive"", given gestational diabetes affects between 5 and 10 per cent of mothers-to-be. Rates have been rising as more older women give birth and with growing weight problems.
The University of Queensland researcher says diabetes in pregnancy significantly increases a woman's chance of pre-eclampsia, delivering prematurely and requiring a caesarean. Their babies are also at higher risk of birth injuries and admission to intensive care.
Later in life, gestational diabetes predisposes both women and their babies to type 2 diabetes.
Callaway says, ideally, women would conceive at ""a healthy weight"", lowering their risk of developing diabetes during pregnancy.
""The reality is because we all lead busy lifestyles, lots of women come to their pregnancy a bit heavier than they should be,"" she says.
Studies trying to prevent gestational diabetes through encouraging women to exercise during pregnancy have failed.
""People just don't seem to be able to do it,"" Callaway says.
""I don't think they don't want to but what happens is they get back pain and nausea and tiredness.
""It's not about lack of intent, it's just lack of reality.""
Leuken puts her gestational diabetes diagnosis down to ""lifestyle choices"", but she's quick to add she has never been a big junk food eater.
""I wasn't necessarily eating bad food but getting food just ad hoc when I could,"" she says. ""Around the time Jhett was conceived, I married my husband, we were building a property, I was working long hours and, of course, I was busy being a mum to Anabella. Then we relocated to Queensland from the Northern Territory in January. With all those major stresses, I was eating out for convenience.""
Leuken has cut out drinking juice, limits the amount of cheese she consumes, only eats wholegrain breads and is careful what cereals she eats since she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.
She exercised regularly while pregnant with Anabella and plans to get active again once her body recovers from Jhett's caesarean delivery.
The 30-year-old says she would willingly take a daily probiotic tablet if it meant she could avoid gestational diabetes in her next pregnancy.
Overweight women less than 15 weeks into their pregnancy who would like to take part in the study should contact Katie Foxcroft on 3646 5146 or email katie.foxcroft@health.qld.gov.au

Type 2 diabetes medication in short supply
Australia is facing a shortage of a slow-release drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes.
The shortfall is believed to be fuelled by growing rates of the medical condition, which has led to demand outstripping supply.
Doctors, pharmacists and patients in WA have been struggling to find extended-release forms of metformin such as Diabex XR, which help control blood sugars by lowering glucose.
It is understood Diabetes Australia has received dozens of calls from desperate diabetes patients complaining about a scarcity of the medication.
Industry publications Medical Observer and Pharmacy News reported yesterday that only four of 30 pharmacies contacted over 24 hours had stock of either the 500mg or 1000mg versions of the medication.
While a global shortage four years ago was blamed on machinery problems overseas, it is understood the current lack of supplies is because manufacturers are struggling to keep up with demand.
Diabetes WA said its educators had confirmed Diabex XR was in short supply.
""This is a special version of metformin with an extended slow release, so we recommend that people living with type 2 diabetes shop around,"" a spokes-woman said.
""If they have trouble obtaining it, they should visit their GP for an alternative script for the standard version of metformin.""
Port Kennedy GP Richard Choong said he had been told new supplies were on their way.

Sleeping diabetics dial dose of insulin
RESEARCHERS are testing a mobile phone device that delivers insulin in a world-first study they hope will prevent type 1 diabetics dying in their sleep.
In the clinical trial of the ""artificial pancreas"" an android phone will take over monitoring insulin needs, removing the need for finger-prick checks.
In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops making insulin, which means the body cannot turn glucose into energy.
Diabetics must manually measure their blood glucose levels via a finger prick or a continuous glucose monitor at least four times a day to determine how much insulin they need.
But endocrinologist Associate Professor David O'Neal at St Vincent's Hospital in Victoria said this was a ""very rough match"".
""We judge the dose of insulin needed on glucose levels taken from one spot in time, whereas the body regulates insulin on a minute-by-minute basis,"" Prof O'Neal said. ""It's like driving a car where you open your eyes eight times on the trip. It's hit and miss."" People can lose consciousness without knowing their blood sugar levels have dropped, and deaths can occur overnight. The closed-loop system includes an android phone controller, a glucose sensor under the skin that instructs the insulin pump every five minutes about how much of the hormone to dispense.

Needles are a daily lifesaver for West Coast footballer Jamie Cripps.

The reality is that every day is a diabetes day for him and will be for life.
The 22-year-old gave an insight into his daily ritual to stay well enough to live his sporting dream.
Cripps has four insulin injections and up to 15 blood tests a day to regulate and monitor his blood sugar, which can be particularly volatile during heavy pre-season training.
He has to eat at certain times and load his diet with carbohydrates such as bread, potatoes and pasta.

""When it comes, I just feel really weak. I start sweating pretty bad and I turn pale.
""I haven't done it too much lately but it's just a bad feeling, just like you've got nothing there.

Yunupingu stands as a warning
THE world is in the midst of one of the greatest chronic disease epidemics in history that, because of its seemingly benign nature, has not had the attention required either on a national or international scale.
Diabetes is on the rise, with rates set to continue to increase globally in the next few decades. The epidemic is fuelled by obesity and sedentary behaviour, which provides a ""toxic"" environment for the development of this insidious disease and its complications. It is occurring in developed and developing nations around the world with the most devastating effects in the lowest socio-economic groups.
Diabetes rates in Australia are high, with prevalence rates estimated to be more than 7 per cent of the adult population. Like other indigenous groups, our indigenous people are at very high risk of developing diabetes, with rates between three and four times higher than in non-indigenous people. There are many reasons, including genetics, poverty and lack of education and resources, particularly in remote communities.
Complications of diabetes include heart, eye, foot and kidney disease, and complication rates in the indigenous population are among the highest in the world and about 10 times non-indigenous rates. It is not well known that Alice Springs has one of the biggest kidney dialysis units in the southern hemisphere. There are now small dialysis units in remote towns in the Northern Territory and the number of patients needing dialysis is on the rise. There is a tsunami of renal failure on the way, with many young patients showing early signs of kidney damage and inadequately controlled diabetes.
In the past few years I have been fortunate enough to be involved in a clinical diabetes services in outreach communities in the Northern Territory. As an Australian and experienced physician, I am shocked and alarmed. It has become obvious that the situation is urgent and is an area of national neglect. For most Australians, it would be difficult to imagine the general health circumstances, lack of facilities and resources that contribute to many preventable chronic medical conditions in remote indigenous communities.
It is fair to say that most remote communities have trouble meeting the demands of acute illnesses and clinicians work long hours to deal with medical emergencies. Dealing with a largely asymptomatic chronic disease such as diabetes has been understandably a low priority. But the devastating complications are now threatening to overtake all other chronic health issues with high levels of morbidity and early mortality.
In my travels I have seen children as young as 12 with type 2 diabetes (mature onset diabetes usually occurring in older age groups). More worrying is the age of patients developing early kidney complications. One youth aged 16 has signs of significant kidney disease. He will no doubt head towards dialysis and death in the next 10 to 15 years. One woman in her early 40s has developed end-stage kidney failure in the space of four years and now faces a lifetime of dialysis and a much shortened life. These situations are all too common in remote indigenous communities and extremely rare in non-indigenous communities. The loss of a great Australian, M. Yunupingu, should serve as a reminder that more needs to be done.
There are many challenges in managing indigenous diabetes. Its nature appears to be more aggressive and less responsive to conventional therapies. Patient education levels are low and so acceptance and compliance with therapy is often poor. The remote nature of many communities means lack of specialist care and lack of continuity of care. But, most importantly, there are not enough resources available for chronic disease management. There is much that needs to be done, and done quickly. Tiny clinics in remote towns need staff devoted to prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications. There needs to be carefully co-ordinated care at every level, from education and health promotion, to new and sophisticated specialist diabetes management.
It is critical that governments are aware of the need for action before a large percentage of the indigenous population is lost to largely preventable complications. The answer is clearly not building bigger dialysis units.
It is time for political parties to turn their attention from border security and mining tax to a much more pressing problem of national importance. If we do not act decisively, we will look back in 10 years and wonder why we didn't.

3D human organs on demand
MEDICAL experts believe the treatment of type 1 diabetes will be revolutionised by Royal Adelaide Hospital's acquisition of a 3D-organ printer.
In an Australian first, the new, cutting-edge technology will be capable of making pancreatic islets suitable for transplant, with pre-clinical trials in the next two years.
Currently, only the most severe cases of type 1 diabetes can be treated with islet cell transplant from human donors. The donor islet cells restore the patient's ability to produce insulin and regulates their blood sugar levels.
The RAH is the first hospital in the country to receive the cutting edge biomedical printing device, developed by researchers from the University of Wollongong and manufactured by former automative company suppler, SMR Automative Australia.

""It is a testament to the bright future of our economy this technology will be manufactured in South Australia by an automotive supplier who has worked to diversify what they are making by entering into the growth sector of medical technology,"" he said.

Diabetes raises risk of cancer
PEOPLE with diabetes have up to a 70 per cent increased risk of developing certain cancers, a new study has shown.
With more than 260 new cases of type 1 and 2 diabetes added to Australia's national diabetes registry daily, experts say the findings should mean cancer screening is part of standard diabetes treatment to help prevent a future epidemic of cancer.
Baker IDI researchers, led by PhD student Jessica Harding, matched about 1 million people on the National Diabetes Service Scheme to national cancer and death registries, comparing this to death rates and cancer incidence of the general population without diabetes.
The study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, found both types of diabetes put people at ""excess risk of incidence and mortality"" overall and for specific cancers.
Type 2 diabetes puts people at greater risk of most cancers, but specifically increased the risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia by 60-70 per cent.
""We think that high glucose facilitates the growth of cancer cells,"" Associate Professor Dianna Magliano said. ""But we don't really know the reasons.""

Band of hope
A report with the headline ""Band of hope"" published on April 9 said a new study had found that gastric band surgery could ""help eliminate type 2 diabetes in people who are overweight, but not in those who are obese"". This was incorrect. It should have said that a new study had found gastric band surgery could help eliminate type 2 diabetes in people who are overweight but not classified obese. Previous research has already shown the gastric band surgery can improve the symptoms of type 2 diabetes in people who are obese. The error was made in production.
Gastric band surgery can help eliminate type 2 diabetes in people who are overweight, but not in those who are obese, an Australian study has found.
Until now, the International Diabetes Federation and other authorities have recommended surgery only for obese people with a body mass index higher than 35 kilograms a metre squared. But the first Australian study of gastric band surgery in overweight people with type 2 diabetes has found it could also be useful for those with a body mass index between 25 and 30. This includes those carrying only a few extra kilograms.
Researchers from the Centre for Obesity Research and Education at Monash University studied 51 people with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of 25 to 30. They were randomly allocated either standard diabetes care or standard care with an adjustable gastric band in the stomach.
Standard care involved consultations with a doctor every three to six months and sessions with a dietitian. All participants were advised to do 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.
Two years on, the average weight loss in the gastric band surgery group was 11.5 kilograms and 12 of the 25 participants, or 52 per cent, were in remission. In the non-surgery group, the average weight loss was 1.6 kilograms and only 8 per cent - or two of the 23 participants who completed two years in the study - were in remission.
There were no serious problems, such as infections or deaths. However, one participant needed surgery to move the band and four experienced ""food intolerance"" due to the bands being too tight.
While weight loss surgery is performed only for severely obese people in public hospitals, the researchers said, it should also be considered for the overweight. In private hospitals, a gastric band costs about $10,000 to $13,000 without health insurance.
""The favourable safety profile and widespread acceptance of laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery argue for a more prominent place for this surgery in management of type 2 diabetes in overweight people,"" the researchers wrote in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology medical journal on Tuesday.
One of the researchers, Emeritus Professor of Surgery at Monash University Paul O'Brien, said although the study was funded by a gastric band manufacturer, it had no role in the design or interpretation of the study, which was independent.
About 5 per cent of the 1 million Australians with type 2 diabetes were of a healthy weight, he said, and about half of the remaining 95 per cent were overweight, with the other half obese.
But, chief executive of Diabetes Australia Professor Greg Johnson said, the study was too small to show gastric bands could safely treat type 2 diabetes in the overweight and people should consider diet and lifestyle changes before surgery which carries risks.
""We would need much larger numbers in the study to look at complications,"" he said.
Carol Kobylinski, who participated in the study, said she had lost about 20 kilograms after the surgery and no longer had type 2 diabetes. Despite a few days' pain in her shoulder after the surgery and reflux, which led to adjustment of the band, she would recommend it to others. ""I've just been so pleased with it,"" she said.

Research offers new hope for diabetics
A DISCOVERY by a global team led by Victorian and American researchers could help develop better insulin products for diabetics.
The scientists have discovered how insulin binds to its target cells in the body.
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute's Dr Colin Ward and Professor Mike Lawrence worked out that the insulin molecule uses a protective hinge to bind to the receptor.
Dr Ward said when insulin bound to the receptor it triggered a series of biochemical events that led to sugar being metabolised by the body.
When its hinge is closed it ensures that the hormone safely remains in storage form, but when it opens, it allows it to dock to the surface of target cells.
The research could help develop insulin products that ensure the protective hinge opens only when it should, allowing it to be stored without refrigeration.
Dr Ward said diabetics do not produce enough insulin. The research, which involved observing crystal structures, was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Diabetes research needs 1500 men
A WORLD-first study to test whether testosterone injections could help prevent type 2 diabetes in men will start in Australia this year.
Up to 1500 men across four states will enrol in the Weight Watchers program and be given regular injections of either testosterone or a placebo.
Lead investigator Professor Gary Wittert, from the University of Adelaide, said men aged 50 to 74 at risk of developing diabetes are being sought for the two-year study.
He said it was the first time such a study had been conducted anywhere in the world.
""Nobody has ever done a proper two-year trial to answer the question of whether giving testosterone prevents the onset of diabetes,"" Prof Wittert said.
""We know that as men get older and gain weight, especially when they become large around the belly, they often suffer from reduced testosterone levels.""
He said men with low testosterone levels were most likely to progress to diabetes.
The $4.8 million study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

New $59m centre to cure disease MIRACLE FACTORY
A NEW state-of-the-art research centre at Mawson Lakes will be dedicated to find treatments for previously incurable and difficult-to-treat conditions - including Type 1 diabetes.
The $59 million Co-operative Research Centre for Cell Therapy Manufacturing at UniSA will use cell-based therapy and smart materials to repair damaged organs and tissues. The facility is tipped to create more than 2000 jobs across Australia by 2021 - mostly in Adelaide.
It will run a world-first human trial of transplanted cells from human donors which might eliminate the need for daily injections of insulin for the more than 100,000 Type 1 diabetes sufferers in Australia.
Other examples of new technology to be developed include a way to prevent rejection of organ transplants by manipulating cells that ""police"" the immune system - removing the need for drugs to suppress natural response.
The centre will also develop stem cells with the potential to heal severe foot wounds - formed when a lack of blood flow deprives tissues of oxygen - offering hope to diabetics who face having their legs or feet amputated.
Centre acting managing director Dr Sherry Kothari said the science of cell therapy had developed to the point where a new industry was ""suddenly starting to rapidly grow"".
""As an industry we're hitting it at the right time, because it is set to grow around the world,"" she said.
""Given that we are based in South Australia and the centre is headquartered here - and we've had very generous support from the State Government and a lot of our key researchers are based here - I think we would see a lot of these benefits within South Australia.""
The centre will bring together materials scientists, cell biologists, bioprocess engineers, clinicians and industry professionals with expertise in advanced manufacturing.
UniSA Professor Rob Short said the work of the new centre would increase the affordability and accessibility of cell therapies.
""Cell therapies offer exciting new possibilities for a range of previously incurable and difficult-to-treat medical conditions including Type 1 diabetes, which affects more than 100,000 Australians,"" he said.
""They will also provide a platform for healing life-threatening ischemic (lack of blood) foot wounds and progress a new technology for organ transplants that could negate the need for immuno-suppressive drugs.""
Prof Short said novel interventions based on smart materials and surfaces would facilitate the cost-effective manufacture and rapid translation of cell therapies into clinical practice.
The Federal Government has provided $20 million over six years to the centre with further funding and support coming from the State Government, research and industry partners.
The centre will also comprise local, national and global manufacturers, researchers from the Queensland University of Technology and Sydney University and from the Royal Adelaide Hospital and St Vincent's and Westmead Hospitals and some key charities.
Its headquarters will be at UniSA's $50 million Materials and Minerals Science building.
UniSA Vice Chancellor Professor David Lloyd said the successful bid to establish the CRC was great news for the university and the state.
""This is a significant area of research that will feed the development of a world-class manufacturing base in South Australia in an area of great benefit locally and globally... It represents exactly the kind of university, government and industry partnership that stimulates relevant innovation.""

Teachers need more training in diabetes 
Khan Power could well owe his life to a teacher who acted quickly when he had a severe ""hypo"" diabetes attack during school swimming lessons a few weeks ago.
The nine-year-old's blood sugars plummeted dangerously low from the usual range of between 4 and 8 to only 1.1, sending him into a hypoglycaemic or low blood glucose emergency.
Luckily, a teacher from his Lockridge primary school Good Shepherd who had been trained in managing type 1 diabetes was watching poolside and saw Khan was pale and in trouble.
The boy was pulled from the water and the teacher tested his blood sugars and treated him with quick-acting carbohydrates and sugars.
""We were really lucky that the teachers at the school have all been trained or briefed in managing type 1 diabetes, and they're very conscious of keeping an eye on Khan,"" his mother Natalie Koltasz said. ""Being in a pool made it even more scary.""
Diabetes WA wants the State Government to fund type 1 diabetes training for teachers.
There are about 1000 students with the condition and the group estimates it would cost between $250,000 and $500,000 depending on the level of training needed and the number of schools that applied for funding.
At present, schools have to pay for staff training themselves and Diabetes WA said some could not afford it.

Fat chance skinny folk are healthy
""FAT people are luckier"" than thin people because they wear the signs of their ill-health, Diabetes Queensland has declared.
The warning comes as they combat the problem of ""skinny fat"" - people who have a bad lifestyle and diet but who believe they are healthy because they are thin.
CEO Michelle Trute has warned thin people who rely on being ""genetically blessed"" for their figure at the expense of good diet and exercise are ""gambling with their health"" and face ""dire consequences"".
She said overweight people wore physical signs of a poor lifestyle, such as clothes or a wedding ring becoming tight, bringing it to their attention.
""They're the people who actually are lucky, their body is giving them alerts to say 'you haven't been eating the right food the last month and I'm not feeling comfortable' and 'you haven't been going on walks this week, what's going on?'"" About 40 per cent of type 2 diabetes cases are induced by lifestyle factors such as smoking which are outside weight.
""A lot of people would look at (thin people) and think they're genetically blessed and they don't have to eat healthy or exercise but... those people are a problem because they're gambling with their health if they do this year in year out, it will have dire consequences later in life,"" Ms Trute said.
She said thin people's ill health was disguised by their small figures and unseen fat around their organs was a ""ticking time bomb"".
Dietitian and QUT PhD candidate Fiona Willer said people can be healthy at any weight, and weight is incorrectly used as a ""proxy"" for health. ""A lot of people who live in thinner bodies live in thinner bodies not because they're doing the right thing but because they're genetically predisposed to that metabolic type situation."" Heart Foundation health director Rachelle Foreman said weight wasn't the only risk factor for heart disease.
""Weight is just one... but there are no visible tell-tale signs other than smoking for heart disease. You can't just look at someone and say 'oh they're healthy' because of their size,"" she said. ""So many will say I didn't have any risk factors... because they're skinny.""

IF you are overweight and pregnant, moderate exercise might cut the risk your baby will be born obese and develop diabetes later in life.
A study in rats has found mothers who exercised moderately while pregnant reduced their offspring's weight, insulin and blood glucose levels.
However, male baby rats were more likely to benefit from their mother's exercise than female babies, the study by a University NSW team led by Professor Margaret Morris has found.
The study saw female rats fed a high-fat diet including pies, cakes, dim sims and biscuits for six weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy.
Babies born to the rats who exercised had smaller fat deposits around the abdomen and improved insulin and glucose metabolism. ""The effects were sex-specific, with males appearing to benefit more from maternal exercise than females,"" the study found, though the authors could not explain why males seemed to benefit more.

Platypus, echidna are natural fit for tackling diabetes 
SOUTH Australian researchers have discovered a hormone in two of the nation's iconic native animal species - the platypus and the echidna - could pave the way for new Type 2 diabetes treatments. The findings which were published in the nature journal Scientific Reports, reveal that the same hormone produced in the gut of the platypus to regulate blood glucose is also produced in their venom, and the venom of echidnas. The hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is also found in the stomach of humans, and stimulates the release of insulin to lower blood glucose levels. It usually degrades in minutes.
But in people with Type 2 diabetes, the release isn't enough to maintain the blood sugar balance and medication, with a longer-lasting form of the hormone, is needed to extend the release of insulin.
However, co-author and University of Adelaide Professor Frank Gr?tzner said their research team found that the hormone had evolved in platypus and echidnas, and made it resistant to the rapid degradation seen in humans.
""This is an amazing example of how millions of years of evolution can shape molecules and optimise their function,"" Prof Gr?tzner said. ""These findings have the potential to inform diabetes treatment, one of our greatest health challenges.""

Old drug performs new cancer trick
Enthusiasm is building about the ability of an old drug to protect against cancer.
Metformin has been around for more than 50 years and is taken by millions of people with diabetes.
It reduces the amount of glucose they produce and controls blood sugar levels.
As glucose also feeds cancer cells, there is a belief the drug may also cut the risk of cancer. By mopping up sugar circulating in the blood, the drug may reduce the cancer's energy supply.
Metformin is a synthetic form of a compound found in French lilac, or goat's rue - a herb used for centuries in folk medicine.
While it is not a cure for cancer, it may potentially reduce the risk of cancer developing.
The hope is that glucose control could be a key in the control of cancer not just among people with diabetes but in the general population.
Metformin may work against cancer in other ways too and is being studied in about 50 trials around the world. While the research to date has produced mixed results, a new review in Cancer Epidemiology looks promising.
Researchers from Shandong University in China analysed 37 studies involving more than 1.5 million people.
They confirmed previous findings that people with type 2 diabetes who took metformin were less likely to get cancer and that even if they did get it, they were less likely to die from it. The drug appeared to have a dramatic effect in cutting the risk of some cancers developing.
The results, which were barely believable, showed the risk of liver cancer was down by 78 per cent, breast cancer by a third, pancreatic cancer by 46 per cent and bowel cancer by almost a quarter in those with type 2 diabetes. Metformin did not, however, seem to help with prostate cancer.
People with type 2 diabetes are known to be at higher risk of death from cancer than their peers in the general population. In 2009, a Dutch study suggested metformin may have a protective effect on people with type 2 diabetes and reduce their risk of a cancer death to that of the general population
In 2011, it was shown that metformin can cut the risk of ovarian cancer and major studies are under way to see if the drug can prevent the recurrence of breast cancer.
While Metformin oral drug is cheap, with a long-established safety profile (it was approved in 1958), it can't be taken thoughtlessly. It may not be suitable for people with heart, liver or kidney problems and can have serious side effects.
Ian Olver, professor and director of Cancer Council Australia, says there is a ""persuasive association"" between metformin use and the decreased risk of cancer.
No cause and effect has been established but the association is interesting and may be a reason people with diabetes who have the choice of drugs choose metformin.

DRINK YOUR WAY OUT OF DIABETES CHEERS TO THIS!
Good news: As you savour your next glass of wine, you can do so in the knowledge it could be lowering your risk of diabetes.
A Danish study found that men and women who drank alcohol three to four times during the week had a 27 per cent and 32 per cent reduced risk, respectively, compared to those who drank less than one drink per week.
But not all alcohol is created equal, according to the researchers. While seven glasses of wine per week was associated with 25-30 per cent lower risk, a similar number of beers reduced diabetes risk in men only (21 per cent lower) and had no effect on women. And it's not such good news for lovers of spirits - seven or more of those over a week actually increased diabetes risk in women by a whopping 83 per cent.

'We will have to build factories to cut off people's toes, feet and limbs'
The rising tsunami of diabetes in Sydney's western suburbs will overwhelm hospitals within 15 years, and specialist factories will need to be built to perform amputations.
This is the warning of Western Sydney Local Health District chief executive Danny O'Connor, who said the bloating of the local population over the past 20 years has created a disaster in waiting that can only be averted by urgent preventative action.
About 300,000 of the 1 million people living in western Sydney are conservatively estimated to have diabetes or be at high risk, with more than half the population of Auburn, Blacktown, Holroyd, Parramatta and the Hills District overweight.
""It's about the survival of the species,"" Mr O'Connor said.
""If we continue to consume too many calories and convert to diabetes, we will have to build factories to cut off people's toes, feet and limbs and help them when they go blind.
""Let's have a conversation about taxing sugary drinks. Let's have a conversation about what's in school canteens. It's a conversation we're at least 10 years too late in having.""
Diabetes costs Australia at least $14.6 billion annually, a figure expected to blow out to $30 billion by 2025, and western Sydney has been identified as a hot spot.
The scale of the crisis facing the local health authority has forced it to move beyond its remit of dealing with acutely ill patients and into preventative health to stop its business model from failing.
It has formed a partnership with food chains, retailers, developers, councils and primary care groups with a goal to effect an average weight loss of four kilograms per person, bringing waistlines back to 1995 levels.
Obesity is one of the main causes of type two diabetes, which represents 85 to 90 per cent of diabetes in Australia. Unlike type one diabetes, it is preventable.
Blacktown endocrinologist Glen Maberly said even a small weight loss would prevent people from developing diabetes.
""We've been failing,"" Professor Maberly said.
""Diabetes is getting more prevalent and people are putting on more weight despite the fact there's been campaigns and people are becoming aware of it.
""That's really setting us up for the impact of this epidemic, and we're at the beginning of it.""
Weight gains lead practice to change shape
Kean-Seng Lim had been practising in Mount Druitt for nearly 20 years when he noticed that his 130-kilogram scales were no longer sufficient to weigh many of his patients.
He upgraded to 160-kilogram scales, but soon these were maxing out and he bought 200-kilogram scales. Again, he underestimated. ""We are now looking at scales that weigh up to 250 kilograms,"" Dr Lim said.
The rising weight profile of the Mount Druitt population was a reason Dr Lim redesigned his practice in 2012 to focus on chronic disease.
A dietitian, clinical pharmacist and exercise physiologist were employed to lend a team approach to individual patient management, and group sessions on exercise and diet - including a virtual supermarket tour - are run every Friday.
On Tuesday, Mavis Ball discussed with the team the management of her asthma, arthritis, cellulitis and how she could reduce weight, as she is a high diabetes risk. Dietitian Dea Krismarietta suggested she eat more fish and take the skin off her chicken to reduce the amount of animal fat. ""That's the best bit,"" Ms Ball protested. ""It's the tastiest.""
Since the practice altered approach it has noted significant improvement in its diabetic patients in terms of glucose control and weight loss.
Dr Lim said one of the difficulties was convincing patients they had a weight problem in the first place.
""They say, 'I'll look too skinny' or 'I'll look sick' or 'I'll get sick',"" Dr Lim said.
""I have to say, 'One of the reasons you think you're normal is because everyone around you is overweight'.""
Fred Mark, 78, was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1990s, when the disease was rare. ""I thought, 'I wonder if you can catch it,' because I didn't know anything about it,"" Mr Mark said. ""Now I could write a book about it.""
Although he has it under control, he said the years of insulin dependence had been draining.
""I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,"" Mr Mark said. ""You've got to change your whole lifestyle.""
The best advice he took from the practice was to buy a smaller plate.

Weight loss the gold key
AUSTRALIAN DIABETES COUNCIL - 75 YEARS
Increasing levels of obesity in Australia over the past 30 years have contributed to an explosion in type-2 diabetes. An obesity physician, Dr Nic Kormas, who works primarily at Camden Hospital, runs two programs to help obese patients with diabetes tackle their weight and fitness issues, and help reduce their dependence on drugs.
""The Metabolic Rehabilitation Diabetes Program has run for the past three years, focusing on the most serious cases of patients with a body mass index [BMI] of 40kg/m2 plus,"" Kormas says.
The program employs a specialist nurse, a psychologist, a dietitian, a physiotherapist, an exercise physiologist and a podiatrist, and involves on-site supervised exercise at least three times a week.
New this year is the BEAT IT PLUS program, an innovative collaboration between the hospital and the Australian Diabetes Council, that allows many more patients with diabetes to be treated effectively.
The council provides a specialist nurse, a dietitian and an exercise physiologist, while the hospital contributes the facilities and allows the council to borrow some of Kormas' time.
Central to both programs is the hospital's specialist gym, with machines catering for patients of up to 250 kilograms - a typical gym can only manage people up to 160 kilograms.
The compulsory exercise program has led to patients forming informal support groups, often involving individuals who might baulk at a more formal one.
Any medical practitioner can refer patients to either of the programs.
Kormas says that for a patient diagnosed with type-2 diabetes who has severe obesity, ""If you lose 10 to 15 per cent of your body weight and improve your fitness levels, your body can return to normal blood-sugar levels, effectively putting your diabetes in remission.""
Kormas is keen to say that this is not a ""cure"" for diabetes, because that would be misleading. He fully expects his successful patients to become diabetic again in 10 to 15 years, but the improved quality of life in the meantime is well worth the effort.
Kormas has found that there are both physical and psychological barriers to his work. ""Some obese people enjoy what they eat, drink and snack on and find it hard to stop,"" he says.
""Others eat, drink and snack for what is effectively pain relief. The first requires education; the second, psychological help.""
About 150 people have now passed through the original program, losing an average of 10 per cent of their body weight. One in four have stopped taking medication (including insulin), and the rest are taking significantly less medication.
""Medically speaking, many of them are extremely complicated people with a variety of other conditions, including obstructive sleep apnoea, arthritis, liver disease and high blood pressure.
""When I got into this field of medicine 17 years ago, I realised that if I could reduce patients' weight and get them fitter, I could outperform any medication at the time.
""One of the best feelings I have is being able to tell someone they no longer have diabetes and no longer need insulin injections.""

Figures show 7489 HBF members with type 2 diabetes were admitted to hospital in 2012 and that almost doubled within a year to 14,547 in 2013. Last year, it soared to 17,017 claims.
Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition when the body becomes resistant to the normal effects of insulin and gradually loses the capacity to produce enough insulin in the pancreas.
It is fuelled by obesity and lack of exercise.
About 100,000 West Australians have the condition and the number of middle-aged people affected in particular is growing.
The insurer said separate figures from health checks by a pharmacy chain showed a similar upward trend, with 68 per cent of middle-aged people at moderate or high risk of getting type 2 diabetes within five years.
HBF managing director Rob Bransby said the disease was growing at an alarming rate - and expense.
""Type 2 diabetes is the ticking time bomb of chronic disease because its symptoms are often hidden and develop slowly,"" he said.
""But we know 25 West Australians are diagnosed with it - including nine of our members - every day.
""Then there's the financial burden this chronic health condition places on our community with type 2 diabetes costing Australia $14.6 billion a year.""
Mr Bransby said half the cases were preventable through better diet and exercise and by people knowing their cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose and body mass index levels.

Diabetics hail PBS listing of super drugs
THOUSANDS of Australians with type 2 diabetes will be able to have one injection a week instead of 14 and save $1600 a year under a new Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing.
Health Minister Sussan Ley will announce today the new diabetes treatment Exanatide (Bydureon) will be listed on the taxpayer-funded PBS improving the lives of up to 20,000 Australians.
The $70 million announcement on revolutionary medicines to be listed on the PBS includes breakthrough treatments for cervical cancer and other life-changing illnesses.
But the new diabetes treatments are expected to be cost neutral. ""As one of our most prominent chronic diseases, type 2 diabetes is placing a significant cost on the nation's health and finances at nearly $1 billion per year,"" Ms Ley said.
""According to Diabetes Australia, there were about 4000 amputations last year that could have been avoided with better daily management. Our hospitals also saw over 900,000 diabetes-related admissions.
""Subsidising innovative medicines like these makes it easier for thousands to keep on top of their diabetes and better manage their medication while not only saving them time and money but also the health system."" The PBS allows millions of Australians to secure subsidised access to lifesaving drugs.
In further announcements to help diabetes sufferers, Linagliptin (Trajenta) and linagliptin with metformin (Trajentamet) as well as vildagliptin (Galvus) and vildagliptin with metformin (Galvumet) will be made available under the new listings, providing patients with additional treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The drugs, used to lower blood sugar levels, will be on the PBS from September 1.

Limb loss soars as diabetes takes toll
EACH day 12 Australians with diabetes lose entire limbs and parts of their feet in largely preventable amputations.
Not only does the extreme surgical intervention reduce the quality and length of patient's lives, it is also a significant burden on the health system.
At least 85 per cent of amputations are preventable, but it's not as simple as diabetics checking their own feet, with reduced nerve sensation making it difficult for them to detect ulcers.
Poor blood flow also means that for a diabetic, a stubbed toe or ulcer can quickly turn into a wound that doesn't heal and eventually requires an amputation of all or part of the foot, Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said.
""It's a staggering number: 4400 amputations every year in Australia and that's just the tip of the iceberg because there are also more than 10,000 admissions to hospitals for diabetic foot problems,"" he said.
Prof Johnson said a lack of a nationally consistent approach to the problem is largely to blame.
""We shouldn't be cutting off people's toes and limbs because of confusion and a divide between state and federal governments,"" Prof Johnson said.
Amputations could be reduced or even eliminated if the fragmented system was replaced by a national system that included regular checks and risk assessments, and earlier treatment.
Each year there are 1108 amputations, 1450 in NSW and 821 in Queensland on patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes. The Australasian Podiatry Council said diabetic foot disease also costs the health system $875 million each year with each lower limb amputation estimated to cost at least $26,000. A group of leading health experts warn more than 520 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes.

Alzheimer's may be late-stage diabetes 
ALZHEIMER'S and diabetes may be the same disease, scientists claim.
They have uncovered evidence that the debilitating form of dementia may be late stages of Type 2 diabetes.
The discovery would explain why nearly three-quarters of patients with this form of diabetes go on to develop Alzheimer's.
Researchers from Albany University in the US believe the excess insulin they produce gets into the brain and disrupts key chemicals.
Type 2 diabetes is triggered by obesity. Around 70 per cent of sufferers go on to develop Alzheimer's, compared with just 10 per cent of healthy men and 20 per cent of healthy women.
Although doctors have known for some time that Type 2 diabetes sufferers are more at risk, there has been little research into the link.
Professor Ewan McNay, a researcher based at Albany University, said: ""People who develop diabetes have to realise this is about more than controlling their weight or diet. It's also the first step on the road to cognitive
decline. At first they won't be able to keep up with their kids playing games, but in 30 years' time they may not even recognise them.""

Diabetes hits thick and thin
CALLS for a local sugar tax have been bolstered by a major Australian-led study showing for the first time that sugary drinks, irrespective of obesity or weight gain, can cause type 2 diabetes.
An Australian National University-led study of 40,000 adults has shown the more sugary drinks consumed by an individual the higher the diabetes risk, meaning skinny people are not immune to the long-term metabolic disorder.
Men and women react differently to sugar-filled drinks and women are far more likely to develop type 2 diabetes from regular consumption.
The study of 40,000 adults from 2005 to 2013 has shown women involved in the study who consumed one or more sugary beverages a day had a 90 per cent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes simply due to their liquid sugar consumption and irrespective of their body mass index. Those who had between one and six sugar-sweetened beverages a week were 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Only men who consumed one or more beverages a day had a 30 per cent increase in risk.

EATING SMART HOLDS THE KEY
A healthy diet and regular exercise are both vital factors in keeping diabetes at bay
More than 100,000 West Australians have diabetes and thousands more will be diagnosed with the condition each year.
It is estimated that for every person diagnosed with diabetes, there is at least one other who has not been diagnosed.
Diabetes WA's Sophie McGough says there are several risk factors that can lead to people developing diabetes, including being overweight or obese, genetics, age and family history.
She said while some of these factors could not be changed, healthy eating and increased exercise could help make a difference.
""There have been very credible studies that have followed people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and have tracked what they eat for more than 10 years,"" she said.
""These studies showed that if these people reduced their weight by 7 per cent and managed 30 minutes of physical activity a day, they could reduce their risk of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis by about 60 per cent.""
Ms McGough said any attempt to become more physically active, reduce portion size, eat less saturated fat and eat more fibre could reduce risk of type 2 diabetes. The measures also could help people who had already developed type 2 better manage the disease.
""Having worked as an accredited practising dietitian for more than 17 years, one barrier to healthy eating has never changed and, in fact, has probably become worse,"" she said.
""Ad hoc meal planning leads to random shopping, which leads to a lack of ingredients in the pantry for making a home-cooked meal.""

Aussies facing an epidemic of hidden disease
MILLIONS of Australians have heart disease and diabetes - but don't know it. The Australian Bureau of Statistics uncovered Australia's hidden disease problems when it tested blood and urine samples from 11,000 people in its regular health survey.
One in three Australians in the survey were found to have high cholesterol but only one in 10 knew it.
The results of the blood tests showed three in four Australians aged over 45 had risk factors for heart disease and nearly half those aged 18-45 had at least one risk factor for heart disease.
Almost one million Australians have been told they have diabetes but the survey found 231,000 have the disease but don't know it.
A further 700,000 are at risk of diabetes.
The blood tests showed one in 10 Australians have chronic kidney disease, and up to 12 per cent have liver problems.
Just over four in 100 Australians have anaemia, a condition that forces the heart to work harder to ensure muscles and organs get the oxygen they need.
Obese adults were five times more likely to have cholesterol problems. The Heart Foundation says the results show that Australia needs more routine checks to identify people at risk of heart attacks, strokes and chronic disease.
""In New Zealand, 60 per cent of the eligible population have had a heart and diabetes check in the past five years,"" Heart Foundation chief Dr Lyn Roberts said.
""Australia is a long way behind our neighbour, with some estimates showing only 5 per cent of Australians are getting a health check by their doctor,"" she said.
Diabetes Australia chief Greg Johnson says other studies have found the rate of undiagnosed diabetes is even higher and is urging all Australians to have a blood glucose test once a year.
While they don't know they have diabetes Australians can be developing kidney and eye problems and other complications, he said.
Australian Medical Association chief Dr Steve Hambleton said every adult in Australia should know their cholesterol level and everyone should be assessed at 45 years of age, or earlier if there was a family history.

Researchers bring fresh hope for type 1 diabetics and their families
Rosina Pavlovic isn't overstating things when she says her son Dane's diabetes dominates her life and that of her family. ""It's huge, it consumes our life,"" she said. Cooking at home where the meal can be tailored is one thing. But going out for dinner invariably means counting carbs before consuming. If it's pizza, Dane's favourite meal, the thickness of the base, size of the slices and toppings are closely scrutinised. Diagnosed when he was 5, Dane has type 1 diabetes, which demands around-the-clock monitoring. It's not uncommon for his father, Zlatan, to stay up until 1am to do one last finger- prick test to make sure Dane's blood sugar levels are OK and he can get through the night. Now 10, Dane is getting to grips with managing his diabetes and is well versed in explaining why he might need to stop playing basketball mid- game or remove himself from the classroom.
""He lives a life of compromises,"" Mrs Pavlovic said of her youngest son. But it may not always be the case for type 1 diabetes patients, after research by American and Australian scientists established what causes the body to mistakenly attack and destroy its own insulin-producing cells. The international team found that when two protein fragments in beta cells - the cells that secrete insulin - collided, they formed a hybrid that the body's immune system mistakenly identified as a foreign object to be destroyed. This leaves people with type 1 diabetes unable to produce insulin, the hormone that regulates the body's use of glucose. University of Colorado research first identified the scenario in mice and it was confirmed in humans by scientists at St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. The findings, published in the journal Science on Friday, will help medical researchers intervene to stop the body attacking itself - potentially meaning a new treatment for those diagnosed with the condition. St Vincent's immunologist Stuart Mannering said the goal was to be able to ""vaccinate"" against auto-immune diseases such as type 1 diabetes. Mrs Pavlovic knows the results will still be a few years off, but welcomed the news. ""It's amazing,"" she said. ""We're closer to finding a way to prevent it and to cure it.""

Weight warning for young as disease risk increases
Young Australians in their 20s and 30s are gaining weight at an alarming rate, setting themselves up for diabetes and heart disease, a landmark study has found.
The trend has renewed calls for a national debate on tougher interventions to turn the obesity epidemic around, including a tax on junk foods and more subsidies for fruit and vegetables.
The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study of 11,000 adults over 12 years found that, on average, people aged 25-34 stacked on 6.7 kilograms - more than any other age group.
For people aged 35-44, the average weight gain was 4.7 kilograms, followed by 2.7 kilograms for people aged 45-54 and 0.4 kilograms for those aged 55-64.
While people over 65 lost an average of 2.1-4.5 kilograms over the 12 years, researcher and Associate Director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute Professor Jonathan Shaw said they were still expanding, with the average waist circumference increasing 0.8 centimetres to 2.7 over the 12 years.
""What I think is happening here is that people are losing muscle mass, but still gaining fat, so the net result on their weight is stable or falling but the net result on their health is negative because muscle is good for us and fat is bad,"" he said. People living in outer regional and remote areas were more likely to gain weight during the study than their urban counterparts, and on average, the waist circumference increase was 50 per cent greater in women than men.
At the beginning of the study in 2000, 22 per cent of participants were obese. This had increased to 27 per cent by 2012. A report on the study released on Monday also shows:
About 269 people over age 25 are developing diabetes every day.
The incidence of diabetes was five times higher among people who are obese and twice as high among those who are overweight.
People living in the most disadvantaged areas were twice as likely to get diabetes as those in the most advantaged regions.
Having diabetes almost doubled the chance of hospital stays and multiple GP visits each year.
Professor Shaw said he was very concerned that people in their 20s and 30s were putting on so much weight, setting themselves up for obesity in middle age, and associated health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.
""It's in the 20s and 30s that the groundwork is being laid,"" he said. ""That's the time when they can most easily turn this around.""
The director of the Public Health Advocacy Institute at Curtin University, Professor Mike Daube, said implications of the current trends for future healthcare costs were ""terrifying"" and needed addressing.

Child diabetes shock
CHILDREN as young as four are developing lifestyle-related type 2 diabetes, putting them at risk of health problems usually only associated with mature adults.
Medical experts have revealed that adolescents with the condition already are being prescribed drugs to prevent heart and kidney disease.
Concerned doctors say the obesity epidemic is triggering increasing numbers of childhood cases of type 2 diabetes - only diagnosed in adults in past generations.
National Diabetes Services Scheme figures show at least 52 Queensland children aged up to 16 have the disease, including a four-year-old, but experts say the real number is probably higher.
Federal Health Minister Peter Dutton said parents needed to learn to say ""no"" to their kids when they wanted to eat junk food.
""We want people to take responsibility for their children and themselves around diet and exercise,"" Mr Dutton said.
""The Government can't and shouldn't be in people's kitchens. ""Many parents already say 'no' to their children who would otherwise be eating fast food every night of the week."" Cairns Hospital endocrinologist Ashim Sinha said about 20 children from the state's far north and parts of western Queensland had been newly diagnosed in the past year, including a five-year-old girl with obesity.
""With the growing epidemic of obesity, we're seeing more and more children with type 2 diabetes all over the world,"" Dr Sinha said.
As well as medications to control blood sugar levels, he said children as young as 13 with type 2 diabetes were being prescribed blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering drugs to prevent severe complications, such as heart attacks and strokes.
They also frequently take tablets to ward off diabetic kidney disease. Dr Sinha said the problem was most prevalent in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, where a mix of genetic, lifestyle and socio-economic factors were involved.
Australian Medical Association federal president Steve Hambleton said it was ""terribly shocking"" that type 2 diabetes was being diagnosed in children aged under 10.
Diabetes Queensland CEO Michelle Trute said children with type 2 diabetes faced a future managing a lifelong condition with potentially serious complications, such as blindness and loss of limbs.
""On top of the immense personal cost, the disease is also a major strain on Queensland's health system,"" she said Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said she was particularly concerned that rates of obesity in Queensland adults were not decreasing. ""As family characteristics and parenting styles are contributing factors to a child's weight, as adults we need to be better role models for the younger generations,"" Dr Young said.

Affording healthcare
Sophie McGough, Diabetes WA educator, said it was hard knowing there was technology available that could help people but for it to be financially out of reach.
""The worst thing is to have someone sit in front of you saying 'I can't work out what is happening with my diabetes' and they are struggling and you know that there is this great technology that could help them to manage their diabetes and get it back under control and yet they can't afford it,"" she said.
The financial burden for people with diabetes was high because it put them at risk of other chronic conditions.
""Each additional chronic condition adds 46 per cent to the likelihood of a person facing severe financial difficulties - hence why early intervention with access to quality diabetes self-management programs that are proven to reduce the risk of diabetes complications is so important,"" she said.
Ms McGough said diabetes was one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease. Once diagnosed with CKD consumers spend an average of $1400 every three months on out-of-pocket medical expenses such as medications, community services and transport.
Tammy Moran, WA's young leader for diabetes, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was eight years old and gradually took on responsibility for covering the costs of its management when she became an adult.
Now 28, Ms Moran said she was vigilant about her diabetes care and would never compromise that to save money but admitted there were times, particularly while she was studying at university, that she'd had to scrape together the money to pay for her test strips.
Each month she spends $41.50 on test strips and just under $8 on insulin. Annually there are three to five visits to a private diabetes educator at around $80-$100 per visit, one visit to a private endocrinologist for $275, a visit to the GP which is $78, and a visit to her optometrist for $60, all of which are rebatable by Medicare.
Ms Moran said her parents had enrolled her in the private system when she was a child and she had continued with this as an adult because it offered better opportunity for one-on-one care than the public system.
Ms McGough said people considering reducing their care to save money should discuss the long-term health implications if they don't take their medications or keep up with regular doctor's visits with their diabetes management team. ""The real expenses happen with diabetes when you get the complications of diabetes - renal dialysis, eye problems or amputation - they require additional expense that are not always completely covered by the health system,"" she said.

Extreme crash diet could help sufferers beat diabetes 
A CRASH diet that has been medically approved could help millions of people with diabetes beat the disease.
Men and women suffering from type 2 diabetes were able to throw away their pills after going on an extreme low-kilojoule diet for just two months.
And 18 months later, some were still free of symptoms and said they were astonished at the dramatic improvement in their health.
So far the diet has only been tested on a handful of patients. But a $4.4 million trial involving 280 diabetics is about to get under way in Britain. These men and women will live on meal replacement shakes and soups. They will be allowed to take in only 3350 kilojoules a day - an amount many people will consume at lunch.
Type 2 diabetes, which normally develops in middle age, is the most common form. There are about a million sufferers in Australia alone.
Professor Roy Taylor, from Newcastle University in the UK, believes fat surrounding vital organs could be the key to understanding the condition.
This fat is thought to clog up the pancreas and liver, cutting insulin production and stopping insulin from being used properly. But crash dieting plunges the body into starvation mode, the fat is burned off and the vital organs are then freed up.

Call for change to Medicare model
Medicare payments should be overhauled to improve care for patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases, a panel of experts has recommended.
In a discussion paper to be launched by Health Minister Sussan Ley on Wednesday, the Abbott government's national diabetes strategy advisory group say the Medicare payment model, in which doctors get most of their income from fees paid for each patient visit, is ""unlikely to lead to optimal outcomes"".
""The fee-for-service model does not incentivise long-term follow-up or the proactive care of people with chronic conditions,"" the paper says.
The group, comprising experts from health groups, universities, research institutes and the public service, calls on the government to experiment with different payment models, which combine fee-for-service payments with other payments based on performance and patient characteristics.
The paper has been produced to kick-start a consultation process for the national diabetes strategy, and comes as the government prepares to announce a broader review of Medicare rebates.
This review, expected to be announced in coming days, would consider whether some services should be removed from the Medicare Benefits Schedule, which cost more than $19 billion last financial year.
A spokesman for Ms Ley said doctors and patients had raised concerns with the government about overtesting and duplication of services, and it would continue to work through these issues.
In 2012, the Gillard government commissioned a review of testing for vitamin D, B12 and folate deficiencies, after pathologists raised concerns about some patients being inappropriately tested. In November 2014, the Abbott government made changes to better target these items, which are expected to deliver savings of $75 million a year.
But the review risks reviving the hostility from professional groups, which contributed to the decision to dump plans for a Medicare co-payment.

Vics' diet crisis
DIABETES is reaching epidemic proportions in Victoria with as many as one in four hospital patients suffering from the chronic health condition.
The Australian-first study of more than 2200 patients at 11 hospitals reveals the prevalence of diabetes has been grossly underestimated.
The findings, published in the Medical Journal of Australia, show a quarter of inpatients had diabetes, putting them at increased risks of a longer hospital stay and readmission.
Most of the patients suffered from type 2 diabetes, which is linked to poor diet and lack of exercise, for about a decade. It showed diabetic patients were more likely to be over 40, heavier and taking medication for high cholesterol or blood-thinning drugs.
Based on diabetes prevalence in the Victorian community, the research indicates diabetes increased the risk of hospitalisation threefold.
The patients were receiving treatment for heart disease, infections, diabetes-related surgery or unrelated conditions. They were more likely to spend almost three days longer in hospital than other patients.
The Alfred's deputy director of endocrinology and diabetes, Professor Leon Bach, said doctors were seeing an ""extraordinary number of patients"" with diabetes. He said improving assistance given to patients with complex conditions could decrease hospital stays and prevent or delay future complications.
Fewer than 60 per cent of patients in the study could recall being seen by a diabetes educator and or dietitian.

Diabetes' price tag heading for $2.9b
The indirect economic cost of rising numbers of ageing Australians with diabetes, measured in ""lost productive life years"", is set to hit $2.9 billion a year by 2030, up from $2.1 billion in 2015.
New research, published in the BMJ Open journal on Tuesday, used population growth and disease trend data to estimate the likely cost of the disease among people aged 45 to 64 years old by 2030.
There are about 1.3 million people with diabetes registered with the National Diabetes Services Scheme, directly costing the federal government about $214 million in the last fiscal year, most of whom had the more common type 2 diabetes.
A study commissioned by Diabetes Australia estimated in 2012 the total annual direct and indirect costs of type 1 and 2 diabetes combined could be as much as $6.5 billion.
The latest study involved medical researchers at the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre and Centre for Rural Health, the Garvan Institute for Medical Research and researchers at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra.
It projected the costs of the ageing diabetes sufferers on the nation's economy, measured in lost income, lost tax revenue, lost GDP, ""lost productive life years"" and rising welfare costs, would reach $2.9 billion by 2030.
Researchers also found the number of Australians who were out of the labour force due to diabetes, measured in ""lost productive life years"" (PLY), would hit 21,400 by 2030, up from 18,100 in 2015, an 18 per cent rise over the 15 years.
The rising number of ""PLYs"" could lead to a 73 per cent increase in losses in national income from the disease, up from $467 million in 2015 to $807 million in 2030.
""For the government, extra annual welfare payments increased from $311 million in 2015 to $350 million in 2030 (a 13 per cent increase) and lost annual taxation revenue increased from $102 million in 2015 to $166 million in 2030 (63 per cent increase),"" the study results showed.
""A loss off $2.1 billion in GDP was projected for 2015, increasing to $2.9 billion in 2030 attributable to diabetes through its impact on lost productive life years (PLY).""
At the individual level, the study also found an increasing income gap between those aged 45 to 64 with diabetes who were forced to leave the workforce, compared with those in full-time work without diabetes.
It showed those who left the labour force due to the chronic disease had a median weekly personal income of about $393.15 in 2015, compared with full-time workers without the disease in the same age group, who earned $1306.81.
""By 2030, the income gap between these two groups is projected to be even greater; with those out of the labour force due to their diabetes receiving an annual income four times lower than that of full-time workers without diabetes,"" the study reads.
The study authors said their research did not take into account other more indirect costs of the disease in Australia, such as ""informal carer costs"", but the high costs of the disease and its burden on the health system was ""an issue requiring urgent policy attention"".

Don't forget your feet
Vital: Canberra Podiatry urges those with diabetes to have a regular foot assessment.
IF diabetes is poorly controlled for a long period of time, it can lead to peripheral neuropathy and/or poor circulation as the excess glucose damages the nerves and blood vessels. It usually affects the feet, first as they are the furthest away from the nerve and blood vessel origins. Nerve damage may result in loss of sensation to your feet making it difficult to detect injury. This, along with poor circulation, delays healing and increases the risk of infection. Infection can lead to serious diabetic complications including amputation and sepsis. A regular foot assessment from your podiatrist will help to detect any vascular and neurological changes early - before they become a problem. Your podiatrist will also look for general foot conditions that may lead to future problems. They will work with you to show you how to monitor your own feet in between consultations. Canberra Podiatry suggests: maintaining acceptable blood sugar levels, exercising regularly, avoiding barefoot walking, keeping your feet clean, wearing well-fitting, protective shoes, cutting and filing nails carefully, having corns, calluses, difficult nails, and other foot problems treated by a podiatrist, inspecting your feet and the inside of your shoes every day, seeing your podiatrist immediately if something is not healing.
Canberra Podiatry has been providing top-quality podiatry and orthotic treatment for Canberra residents for more than a decade. The clinic provides complete podiatry care by offering a combination of diabetic foot assessments, general treatments, ingrown and fungal nail surgery, biomechanical analysis and orthotic therapy. For your convenience, the clinic stocks a range of affordable orthotic- friendly shoes, bamboo socks and foot- care products. If you require a diabetes foot check, suffer from general foot problems or any other lower limb muscle and joint pain, contact Canberra Podiatry.

Energy drink study shock
CAFFEINATED energy drinks cause a 25 per cent spike in teenagers' blood glucose and insulin levels even when they contain no sugar, alarming new research shows.
A study to be presented to a world diabetes conference in Vancouver has found the caffeine alone in the drinks could predispose people to diabetes and heart disease.
Around 30 per cent of teens and half of all young adults consume the drinks which have been associated with a handful of deaths worldwide and over 300 health events, including 128 hospitalisations in Australia.
Consumption of the drinks in Australia surged fivefold in the decade to 2010 and some experts are calling for them to be banned from sale to those aged under 18.
Heidi Virtanen, from the University of Calgary in Canada, will tell the conference a study of caffeinated drinks in adolescents found they caused a 20-30 per cent increase in insulin and glucose levels.
""Since caffeine persists in the system for 4-6 hours after consumption, continuous insulin resistance associated with regular caffeine-containing energy drink consumption in adolescents could contribute to increased metabolic risk in susceptible individuals later in life through persistent interference with their regular glucose metabolism,"" she said.
The chief concern about energy drinks is the amount of caffeine they contain and the fact they are aggressively marketed to children.
Energy drinks typically contain around 80mg of caffeine.
Deakin University research has found, on average, children first use these drinks at the age of 10 in Australia.
Children and adolescents are much more likely to ingest higher amounts of caffeine per kilogram of body mass when they consume these drinks because they are smaller than adults. A Canadian study of teenagers, showed a 25 per cent increase in blood glucose levels in the two hours after consuming the caffeine-containing energy drink compared to the decaffeinated version. Insulin levels surged by 26 per cent.

Calls to ease insulin pump access
When Hannah Weber was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was two-years-old, her mother Adrienne Cottell went into a state of shock.
While coming to terms with the diagnosis was difficult, a task equally as challenging was trying to administer lifesaving insulin injections multiple times a day to a toddler. ""It was impossible, because it meant that she had to go onto fixed feeding times, and toddlers don't go on fixed feeding times,"" Ms Cottell said.
However, when doctors recommended Hannah use an insulin pump - a small device attached to the body that delivers regular doses of insulin - to manage her diabetes, things changed dramatically. ""She could go and be a toddler again and be able to eat and play normally, and we could increase or decrease the insulin needed,"" Ms Cottell said.
When Hannah's twin sister Olivia was also diagnosed with diabetes when she was six, she was placed onto an insulin pump immediately. Now both aged nine, both see using the pump as part of their daily routine. ""They both think it's a part of life to wear a pump... and it means staff at their school don't have to give them injections,"" Ms Cottell said.
While insulin pumps have made managing diabetes easier for Hannah and Olivia, the help doesn't come cheaply, with the average pump costing more than $9000. Government-funded subsidies are available, however, they are limited to people under 18, with patients having to then pay for the pumps themselves or take out private health insurance. The funding arrangements surrounding insulin pumps are being examined as part of a wide-ranging Senate committee inquiry into medical prostheses. The committee is set to hand down its findings on May 10.
Chief executive of Diabetes Australia Greg Johnson said the subsidy should be expanded as more people use insulin pumps.
""The real issue for the decision makers is the pumps shouldn't be seen as a luxury, this is standard fair and should be accessible to people,"" he said. ""The evidence is very strong and helps with diabetes management, and pump therapy is cost effective and helps to prevent complications.""
Out of the 120,000 Australians living with type 1 diabetes, it's estimated 15 per cent are using pumps. However, 50 per cent of children diagnosed with the condition are using pumps as their main treatment option, with that number expected to rise.
A spokesman for the Department of Health said current funding for the Insulin Pump Program provides up to 68 subsidies per year, with the number dependant on the cost of the chosen pump.
As of March there were 17 applicants on the waiting list for the subsidy, with 323 applicants on the expression of interest list.
Associate professor Jane Holmes-Walker from the Australian Diabetes Society said while access to insulin pumps should be expanded to diabetes patients who aren't able to afford private health insurance, legislation surrounding the pumps should be changed to allow for changing technology.

Landmark medical trial hub opened
AN Australian-first clinical trial to assess wearable technology that can warn young Type 1 diabetics and potentially their carers about low blood sugar episodes will get under way in Adelaide.
The research will be conducted by CMAX, which today opens its new trials facility on North Terrace, opposite the SA Health and Medical Research Institute.
Melbourne-based Firefly Health and Grey Innovation, which makes the wristwatch-like device, has contracted CMAX to undertake the research on between 20 and 40 children and adolescent volunteers from the Women's and Children's Hospital.
The first study was done on a dozen adult Type 1 diabetics by CMAX at its former facility in the old Royal Adelaide Hospital.
""These studies and their potential health outcomes are exciting,"" said CMAX's clinical services vice-president Jane Kelly. ""Over two decades, our early stage trials have assisted in improving of the quality of life for many people."" Another collaborative gene therapy study for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease involving the SAHMRI, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, RAH and a Japanese biopharmaceutical company is also due to start soon.
Ms Kelly said more collaborations would be possible with the group's siting in the heart of what's shaping up to be Adelaide's biomedical precinct.
CMAX, now owned by Victorian publicly-listed company IDT Australia, has conducted more than 500 clinical trials for more than 60 global pharmaceutical and biotech companies in its 22 year-plus history at a rate of 25 to 30 studies a year.
Some of its long-term clients are Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck and it is also seeing a lot of demand from Asia. Japan's I'rom Pharmaceuticals is also a stakeholder in IDT Australia.
""Time is money for these companies. Australia's strong regulatory regime and quality of research are key factors influencing this demand,"" said Ms Kelly.
Parent IDT Australia, which reported half-year revenues of $6.5 million to the end of December and a loss after tax of $3.5 million, expects ""growing revenues"" from the new 50-bed facility.
CMAX's move to the new location has cost IDT close to $1 million. With 36 permanent staff and 60 casuals, including medical staff, the facility operates 24/7.Volunteers, sometimes students and people looking for income on the side, are paid based on a range of factors and are subject to ethics committee approval.

No bail for man who cut boy's insulin
Alternative therapy Charged had no medical qualifications
A Chinese ""self-healing promoter"" accused of causing the death of a six-year-old boy allegedly described Western medicine as ""poison"" and encouraged diabetics to participate in slapping therapy instead of taking their insulin.
Hong Chi Xiao was charged with manslaughter in August, following a two-year investigation into the boy's death, during which time Mr Xiao continued to promote his techniques around the world.
He is also being investigated in Britain following the death of an elderly woman who attended one of his workshops last year.
Mr Xiao, a US national, conducted the $1800-a-week course in which the boy took part at the Tasly Healthpac centre in Hurstville in April 2015.
The NSW Supreme Court heard during Mr Xiao's bail application on Wednesday that he denied the child insulin for five days and put him on a fasting regime that involved only dates and ginger water while he was carrying out the slap therapy, even when it became apparent that the boy's condition was deteriorating.
Other attendees at the workshop observed that the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was vomiting regularly after a few days.
Mr Xiao attributed this to the poisonous effects of the insulin.
The child finally became so weak he could not walk and his parents had to push him about in a pram, and Mr Xiao allegedly advised the parents to check into the hotel where he was staying so he could keep a closer eye on him.
But on the night of April 26, 2016, Mr Xiao went out to a Chinese restaurant with those who were assisting him and the child had a seizure at the hotel and lapsed into unconsciousness, from which he never recovered. He died of diabetic ketoacidosis. His parents and grandmother have also been charged with manslaughter.
According to the Crown statement of facts, Mr Xiao had no medical qualifications.
He worked as an accountant until the age of 40, when he started conducting ""self-healing workshops"" in the practice of PaidaLajin, an alternative medicine technique that involved slapping, pulling and stretching the skin until it bruised.
In a video presentation tendered to the court, he claimed that diabetics did not need to take their insulin after practising the technique and would only need to consume sugar water daily for the maintenance of good health.
The prosecution opposed bail on the grounds that Mr Xiao posed a flight risk and a danger to the community due to his ""extremely strong belief"" in PaidaLajin.
""And there could be no more powerful example of this than to slap a six-year-old child who has type 1 diabetes consistently for five days. He must have known that the child was deteriorating rapidly and, at that point, to tell the parents that this was a natural thing and to not give him insulin is... a measure of the extent of the breach of duty of care that he had assumed, the Crown submits.""
Mr Xiao allegedly told workshop participants that PaidaLajin generated insulin and that most people with diabetes who tried it were healed.
Workshop participant Sharon Lin said: ""Before going around the room, Mr Xiao would give a little talk. He would say that medicine is poison and that when doctors go on strike the death rate drops and that Western medicine can't cure but PaidaLajin can.""
The child's GP told the court that to take a diabetic off insulin was akin to ""signing their death warrant"".
Mr Xiao's barrister Gregory Woods, QC, said his client was willing to adhere to strict bail conditions.
But Justice Elizabeth Fullerton refused bail on the grounds that he posed a flight risk and presented a danger to the community.

Gastric surgery a diabetes fix
Weight loss rethink Lap-band leads to health breakthrough
Lap-band surgery can help eliminate type 2 diabetes in people who are overweight but not so overweight they are obese, an Australian study has found.
Until now, the International Diabetes Federation and other authorities have only recommended surgery for obese people with a body mass index over 35 kilograms per metre squared. But the first Australian study of gastric band surgery in overweight people with type 2 diabetes has found it could also be useful for people with a body mass index between 25 and 30.
Researchers from the Centre for Obesity Research and Education at Monash University studied 51 people with type 2 diabetes who had a BMI of 25 to 30. They were randomly allocated to standard diabetes care or standard care with an adjustable gastric band inserted around their stomachs during keyhole surgery. Standard care involved consultations with a doctor every three to six months and sessions with a dietitian. All participants were advised to do 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.
Two years on, the average weight loss in the surgery group was 11.5 kilograms and 12 of the 25 participants, or 52 per cent, were in remission, defined as a glucose concentration of less than 7 millimoles per litre at fasting.
In the non-surgery group, the average weight loss was 1.6 kilograms and only 8 per cent - or two of the 23 participants who completed two years in the study - were in remission.
There were no serious adverse events, such as infections or deaths. However, one participant needed revision surgery to move the band and four people experienced five episodes of ""food intolerance"" due to the band being too tight.
While weight loss surgery is only carried out for severely obese people in public hospitals, the researchers said it should be considered for overweight people too.
In private hospitals, a gastric band costs about $10,000 to $13,000 if you do not have health insurance.
""The favourable safety profile and widespread acceptance of laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery argue for a more prominent place for this surgery in management of type 2 diabetes in overweight people,"" the researchers wrote in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology medical journal on Tuesday.
Paul O'Brien, one of the researchers and an emeritus professor of surgery at Monash University, said although the study was funded by a gastric band manufacturer, it had no role in the design or interpretation of the study which was independent.
While about 5 per cent of the 1 million Australians with type 2 diabetes are of a healthy weight, he said about half of the remaining 95 per cent were overweight, with the other half obese.
But Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said the study was too small to show gastric bands could safely treat type 2 diabetes in overweight people and he said people should consider diet and lifestyle changes before surgery, which carries risks.
""We would need much larger numbers in the study to look at complications,"" he said.
Carol Kobylinski, who took part in the study, said she had lost about 20 kilograms after the surgery and no longer had type 2 diabetes. Despite having some pain for a few days in her shoulder after the surgery and reflux, which caused the band to be adjusted, she would recommend it to others.
""I've just been so pleased with it,"" she said.

Carbs the fat villain
EXCESS sugar and carbohydrates rather than a lack of exercise are behind the surge in obesity and diabetes, some experts say.
Even people of normal weight are at risk of health issues by eating too many carbohydrates, they warn.
Eating fat and protein would cut our risk of diabetes and other problems, say the experts, who include a South African cardiologist, a sports scientist and a physician.
The advocates of the low-carb diet write in an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine today that the prevalence of diabetes increases 11-fold for every 630 additional sugar kilojoules consumed daily, compared with the equivalent amount of kilojoules consumed as fat.
A high-sugar, high-carbohydrate diet can damage even the health of up to 40 per cent of those of normal weight, putting them at risk of hypertension, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease and heart disease, say the experts, who appeared in a controversial ABC Catalyst program on low-carb diets in November.
Sports scientist Professor Tim Noakes and physician scientist Dr Steve Phinney accuse the food industry of using tactics ""chillingly similar to those of Big Tobacco"".
""Recent research indicates that cutting down on dietary carbohydrate is the single most effective approach for reducing all of the features of the metabolic syndrome and should be the primary strategy for treating diabetes, with benefits occurring even in the absence of weight loss,"" they write.
Public health messages encouraging kilojoule counting ignore evidence that it is the source of the kilojoules that mattered, the writers say.
National Health and Medical Research Council dietary guidelines recommend 30 per cent of a healthy diet should be carbohydrates such as bread, wholegrains and legumes, a further 10 per cent fruit, and fats only ""in small amounts"".
Dietitian Rosemary Stanton, who helped write the guidelines, approves of cutting cakes, biscuits and sugary breakfast cereals but not wholegrains and fruit, which cut the risk of bowel cancer and diabetes and provide more vitamins than a low-carb diet.

Condition in pregnancy spurs a focus on staying active
Bree Abbott was shocked to discover she had gestational diabetes during her first pregnancy.
Slim, fit and with no known family history of diabetes, she said even her doctor was surprised.
Diet, exercise and, late in the pregnancy, tablets helped control her sugar levels.
But she had a tougher time during her second pregnancy when she was once again diagnosed with gestational diabetes. This time around, lifestyle changes were not enough and she had to inject herself with insulin four times a day until she was induced a week early because the baby was too big.
Although her blood sugars returned to normal after both pregnancies, Ms Abbott knows her history of gestational diabetes puts her at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. About two years after the birth of her youngest, Ms Abbott said a genetic link to diabetes emerged, adding to her risk profile.
Her dad was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and then her brother was diagnosed with type 1. Her focus now is to use exercise and healthy eating as ways to minimise that risk.
""The doctor said to me I am at risk of getting type 2 diabetes in the future if I don't look after myself... he really emphasised that exercise is very important in preventing it,"" she said.

WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
Diabetes and alcohol make a poor mixer
FURTHER information regarding diabetics and alcohol.
SOME people with diabetes may need to have less alcohol than these general recommendations, which is currently two standard drinks a day, due to their age, medication or the need to lose weight.
It is therefore important for individuals to discuss this with their diabetes health care team.
If individuals are overweight, have had trouble managing their blood glucose, have high blood pressure, high triglycerides or other complications, their health care team may advise them to drink less or not to drink at all.
Individuals taking insulin or certain diabetes tablets are at risk of alcohol-related hypoglycaemia ('hypos') which can be dangerous as the glucose lowering effect of alcohol can last up to 24 hours, or longer, after the last drink. sometimes even longer.
Glucose stores are often lower during the night, in the morning, during and after exercise and when you haven't eaten.
Alcohol blocks glucose production by the liver, thus, it can cause delayed hypoglycaemia.
Impairment of the senses by a combination of alcohol and hypoglycaemia is dangerous, and blood glucose levels should therefore be checked regularly especially before going to bed.
To find out more about alcohol and diabetes, one can consult the Dietitians Association of Australia on 1800 812 942, or the State or Territory Diabetes Organisation on 1300 136 588.

Employers often need an injection of facts
AUSTRALIAN DIABETES COUNCIL - 75 YEARS
Sufferers are still wrongly considered a burden, writes Owen Thomson.
Despite enormous breakthroughs in community attitudes and awareness, diabetes experts say sufferers may still be seen as a ""burden"" in some workplaces.
""You're really not allowed to ask about medical problems when you're being interviewed for a job,"" says Kristen Hazelwood, head of education and prevention at the Australian Diabetes Council. ""But sometimes the boss can find out because a person has a hypo [glycaemic reaction] or maybe needs a bit of assistance, and all of a sudden that person may be seen as a burden. When this happens, it's really horrible.""
Professor Don Chisholm, a leading diabetes researcher from the Garvan Institute, understands the challenges faced by diabetics in the workplace. He says there is some residual prejudice but it can be mitigated by education.
""There is still stigma and discrimination, but these days it's more likely to occur in small community situations where everybody knows everybody's business,"" he says. ""The more the community understands diabetes, the better.""
Perhaps the most baffling aspect of such discrimination is that diabetes does not necessarily affect productivity. With better management strategies available, experts say that in most cases, having diabetes need not be an impediment to enjoying a productive working life and having a broad range of vocational opportunities.
""Most people with diabetes try very hard to manage their condition, and if they do... they're usually healthier than the other people in their office because they're eating healthily, they're exercising, they're doing all the right things, so in actual fact, they're far more productive,"" Hazelwood says.
While some allowances need to be made for those with diabetes, the necessary management strategies cause only minimal disruption or time out from work.
""They may need to monitor their blood-glucose levels,"" she says. ""They may need to have a snack because their blood-glucose levels go a bit lower depending on their use of certain medications. Some people may even give themselves insulin injections in their workplace, but because they're so used to doing it, the time spent is negligible.
""So while they do need some special considerations, it's nothing compared with the impact of going out for a smoke like other people might do.""
Chisholm, who says community and employer attitudes have improved a lot in the past 40 years, also stresses the minimal effect of an employee's diabetes on work schedules.
""Someone on insulin does need to eat on time, give their insulin injections on time, and be able to do a finger-prick blood-sugar level as necessary,"" he says. ""But it's only going to take them 15 to 30 seconds.
""Of course, a lot of people with milder type-2 diabetes who are on tablets that don't cause low blood-sugar reactions don't really need any special consideration than what they usually would have, such as meal breaks, and so on. They might only do one or two blood-sugar readings a day and wouldn't necessarily need to do them during working hours. It's very dependent on the individual case and the type of diabetes.""
Chisholm says although improvements in diabetes management have enabled people to do jobs that would previously have been difficult to carry out safely, legitimate restrictions around some professions still remain.
""The fact that someone might get a severe hypoglycaemic reaction does actually preclude some sorts of employment,"" he says. ""So you couldn't possibly have a type-1 diabetic patient as an airline pilot, operating a crane above a city building or working on high scaffolding, for instance.
""These are occupations where if they did get a low blood-sugar reaction that caused them to be mentally confused, they might be a danger to themselves or others.
""But there are also jobs that there should be no problem with them doing, such as a bank teller or a bank manager. Fortunately, employers and the community are now much more accepting of looking at the individual job and the individual person to assess their capability.""
Ultimately, when it comes to managing diabetes in the workplace, Hazelwood says employer and employee have clear-cut responsibilities. This starts with diabetic employees informing their workmates of their condition, despite the fact they may want to keep it quiet.
""That's because if something goes wrong, at least they know what's happening,"" she says.
""At the same time, the responsibility of the employer is to allow the person to manage their condition and not create barriers that could put their employee at risk.""

Cloud cuts kids' comas
THE parents of children with Type 1 diabetes live in constant fear of a low blood-sugar attack that could send their child into a coma but new technology has come to the rescue.
A system called Tidepool can now collect blood-sugar readings from the child's insulin pump, regular continuous glucose monitoring tests and measurements from activity trackers such as FitBit and then upload them to the cloud.
It will enable parents and doctors to obtain reports that identify patterns in a child's insulin levels connected to sport, birthday parties, eating times and restaurant visits - allowing them to better predict how much insulin a child will need around these events.
Eventually the information will allow parents to be alerted via a watch or a mobile phone when their child's blood-sugar readings are crashing so they can correct the problem.
And experts hope it could advance the development of an artificial pancreas where a continuous glucose monitor could be linked to an insulin pump and automatically adjust a patient's insulin levels as required.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is working with Tidepool to advance the technology.
""Anything that makes the management of such a difficult disease easier is a great benefit,"" JDRF chief executive Mike Wilson said. The initiative is the work of a group of interested parents who have formed a not-for-profit organisation, Tidepool, to get diabetes device manufacturers to release their data so it can be shared with data from other device companies.

Stalling the regional scourge of diabetes 
JOHN Turtle is one of Australia's noted diabetes experts, having spent 50 years raising awareness about a disease that affects almost two million Australians.
Dr Turtle has been nominated for this newspaper's Australian of the Year not just for his efforts on home soil but also for those abroad, in Fiji.
When Dr Turtle wrote his doctoral thesis on diabetes in 1969, he was writing for the four decades to come, four decades in which the disease has become an epidemic in Australia.
Today, hope rests with medical professionals working to find a cure.
The Sydneysider spent 31 years as the head of the endocrinology department at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and as a professor of medicine at the University of Sydney.
In response to an invitation from Fiji's prime minister at the time, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Dr Turtle and his team played a key role in establishing the first Fiji National Diabetes Centre in the early 1980s.
The International Diabetes Federation, where Dr Turtle was vice-president for six years, says in the Western Pacific one-third of adults have diabetes.
Dr Turtle was awarded the Order of Fiji in 1999 and is a leading global authority in endocrinology.
Nominations for Australian of the Year are now open and a winner will be announced on January 25.

In the last 10 years 10,000 Australians went blind as a result of diabetes and another 300,000 have diabetic retinopathy which makes it difficult to read and watch television.
Around one million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and another 700,000 are believed to have the disease but do not know it.
""With the number of Australians affected by diabetes expected to double in the next decade... diabetic eye disease is creating significant personal, public health and economic challenges,"" Associate Professor Jonathan Shaw from the Baker IDI Institute said.
Diabetic retinopathy occurs when blood vessels inside the retina at the back of the eye are damaged as a result of diabetes. The Centre for Eye Research (CERA) in Australia says currently 50 per cent of people with diabetes are not having regular biannual eye checks to test for retinopathy. Vision loss can be prevented by regular eye checks and medical treatment.

Designers have been applauded for their fashion that not only looks great, but also accommodates lifesaving devices for diabetics such as winemaker Kate Laurie
When you're pregnant, everything is about the baby. I didn't drink - even though I'm a winemaker - and I ate healthily. I had Eliza, Emily, and then fell pregnant with Annabelle.
At 24 weeks, I went for a check-up and got a shock. I had gestational diabetes and my sugars were uncontrollably high.
I was put straight on to insulin and given a crash course on counting carbs and calculating my insulin requirements, depending on food, activity, and even stress levels.
Initially, I coped fine. It just got caught up in all the other pregnancy measures I was taking and I actually felt quite relieved to have an explanation as to why I'd recently felt the out-of-character need to wolf down an entire packet of Tim Tams!
It wasn't until I had my first hypo (a reaction when blood glucose levels drop too low) that the enormity of diabetes really hit me. It was very frightening and I was grateful I was in a medical centre at the time with people who understood, fed me lollies and sat with me till I felt better.
Annabelle was born healthy in September 2009 and I hoped my own health would also return to normal, but tests quickly showed that wasn't to be.
I had type 1 diabetes and would need to inject insulin and constantly monitor my blood sugars for the rest of my life.
Suddenly, I was dealing with breastfeeding, hormonal changes and a chronic disease. There were days when it was quite a frightening ride.
With three children to care for and a very physical job running the winery with my husband Hamish, it soon became obvious that injections weren't the ideal solution, so I went into hospital to get an insulin pump that could deliver insulin through a cannula in my stomach or hip and be fine-tuned to my body's needs.
I felt quite excited about it until I went to the bathroom for the first time. ""You look really unhappy,"" the rep said when I came out.
""I've just realised I have something attached to me for the rest of my life and it's quite awkward,"" I replied.
I was given a little pouch belt to wear around my middle. The mobile-sized pump sat inside and it was easy to pull it out and check my levels.
However, if I went out socially or to give a presentation and wanted to wear a nice dress, things were a little more complicated. I didn't know where to put the pump.
I spoke to other women. Some put their pump in their bra, but that was uncomfortable. Others wore a special garter, but that could easily fall down.
Either way, I couldn't quickly pull the pump out to check it. It meant if I went out to dinner and needed to check the pump for any reason, I had to interrupt the conversation, leave the table and go to the bathroom. It happened up to six times an hour.
I wasn't embarrassed about having diabetes - indeed I'd like to see it normalised, so that we're like asthmatics with their puffers and can pull out a pump or give an injection and no one blinks an eyelid. I just found it awkward.
I joined a diabetes group, Type 1 Voice. I liked them because they were proactive about making life better for people with diabetes.
I volunteered on a kids' camp and felt blessed that I hadn't been diagnosed until my thirties.
Many were teased at school and called ""junkie"" for injecting or ""robot"" for the beeping of their pump. Their parents probably never had an uninterrupted night's sleep again as they set the alarm for 2am to check on their sleeping child's blood sugars to ensure they didn't have a hypo in the night.
Sleepovers must have been seriously scary.
I gave talks for Type 1 Voice, assisted with projects and campaigns and also helped with fundraising, including organising a fashion show at our Deviation Road Winery in the Adelaide Hills.
A few weeks before the event, I was having dinner with my friends Mel and Dean Flintoft of Australian Fashion Labels, who were providing outfits, when I told them how annoying it was not to be able to wear dresses.
Mel listened, then said: ""Kate, it's not rocket science. We could easily put a concealed pocket in a dress with a buttonhole behind it to feed the pump tubing through."" I looked at some of her designs. There were dresses with peplums. ""That's the perfect place to put a pump,"" I said. ""You wouldn't even have to come up with a new design."" Mel and Dean showed me other dresses with beautiful folds in the skirts where pumps could also easily be concealed while remaining easy to access. They were really glorious, sexy dresses, too.
""Do you think we'd be able to get this product up and running in time to launch it at the fashion show in February?"" I asked.
In the end, they produced enough dresses for four of us to step out on to the catwalk.
I almost cried the first time I put mine on.
I felt fantastic and when we explained the story behind the dresses, there were even men weeping in the audience.
One of the women at the event told how she was completely hypo-unaware and needed an ambulance every two months or so because of a collapse.
One of the teens explained that she was so into fashion and so sick of not being able to put the pump anywhere, she'd gone back to needles. Now she could return to a more convenient, safe way of delivering insulin.
Afterwards, I had people coming up and saying they had no idea what we had to live with or how such a simple thing could make life easier and nicer.
We all felt really good and Mel and Dean said that in future they'd look at all their dresses to see if they could be customised for pump-wearing diabetics who wanted them.
Since launching the dresses, I've heard from chemo nurses who have told me they would also be good for their patients who need to wear pumps.
Mel and Dean were delighted. They had no idea that people's fashion choices could be limited by a health condition.
I initially mooted the idea of the fashion show to raise funds for Type 1 Voice because fashion is a global statement of how people feel.
We ended up illustrating that very clearly. When form and function come together, it can go a long way in boosting both emotional and physical confidence in those who most need it. As told to Beverley Hadgraft To see the range of dresses, go to fashionbunker.com/type-1-voice

Gestational diabetes a growing issue
Working with a pioneer in diabetes was inspirational for a Melbourne obstetrician.
Dr Peter Wein developed an interest in gestational diabetes almost by accident. After training in obstetrics and gynaecology, he was offered a job at the Mercy Hospital For Women where he worked with the late Professor Norman Beischer.
""He was an international pioneer in gestational diabetes,"" says Dr Wein.
Professor Beischer had insisted, from the time the Mercy started in 1971, that all pregnant women should have a glucose tolerance test.
Doing so helped women and babies, and put the hospital's procedures ahead of the rest of the world by some decades.
""We used to diagnose more women than other hospitals, which didn't test. At that time the prevalence of diabetes was rapidly increasing, from 2 per cent in 1980 to about 8 per cent in 1995. So, we had lots of women with the condition and I had to learn how to manage it,"" he says.
The experience inspired a continuing interest in the field. Meantime, instances of gestational diabetes continues to rise.
""It has been increasing over the years in the same way that diabetes in general has. Gestational diabetes now affects 10 to 15 per cent of pregnancies,"" Dr Wein says.
During pregnancy, the body's need for insulin is two to three times higher. Gestational diabetes can develop if a woman's body can't produce higher levels. A combination of factors are thought to be behind the condition's causes, including weight, genes, ethnic origin and age. Gestational diabetes differs from what is known as pre-pregnancy diabetes; that is, women who have diabetes prior to conceiving.
""While they both involve high sugar levels, pre-pregnancy diabetes is much more serious and has higher complication rates,"" says Dr Wein. Gestational diabetes is tested for and treated during pregnancy. After delivery, Dr Wein says the condition goes away in 98 per cent of women, although there is about a 50 per cent risk those women will become diabetic outside of pregnancy at some stage later in life.
""A study done in Australia in the '90s showed that if gestational diabetes is not treated, there is a higher risk of the baby getting too big, having difficulty in delivery, needing a caesarean section, the mother getting high blood pressure and the baby getting low blood sugar levels after it is born, as well as jaundice,"" Dr Wein says.
He treats gestational diabetes and other medical disorders in pregnancy, in addition to providing a range of care to mothers and babies.
Obstetrics is in the family, with his wife, Jennifer, running the practice, and his father also an obstetrician.
""He still assists me at caesarean sections so I still get him up sometimes in the middle of the night,"" says Dr Wein.
His eldest son is a medical student, and his other children hope to follow the family tradition. As well as being in private practice in East Melbourne, Dr Wein is a consultant obstetrician at the Mercy Hospital for Women and attends Epworth Freemasons Maternity Hospital, Frances Perry House and St Vincent's Private Hospital.

Debilitating risk of diabetes not being taken seriously enough
It is World Diabetes Day today, and Caroline Wells says it is the perfect time to face facts
Last month on a trip to the United Kingdom, I met Chris Askew, the chief executive of Diabetes UK, and some of his key staff.
Part of the reason was to share our experiences in dealing with the world's fastest growing chronic disease; to understand the impact at a personal and societal level; and to change what seems to be a widespread view that diabetes is not serious and ""it won't happen to me"".
Last year I wrote a Talking Point article about the misconceptions in our community about diabetes and, sadly, these are mirrored in the UK. Only 1 per cent of people in the UK surveyed in 2013 were worried about diabetes and only 25 per cent of people believe it is a serious condition. Why is this so? We know diabetes can lead to severe complications such as blindness and amputation.
A survey in Tasmania done by EMRS in February showed 30 per cent of respondents identified, unprompted, that amputation and blindness were key health consequences of diabetes. Yet in Tasmania every four days a Tasmanian has a lower limb amputation related to diabetes, and one in four hospitalisations for diabetes are preventable.
This difference between knowledge and action led us to discuss another similar challenge, which was how to encourage people with diabetes to increase their knowledge about self-management. In the UK only 5 per cent of people with diabetes attend courses on offer to help them do this. This is similar to Australia.
Living with diabetes is 24 hours, seven days a week. Only a few hours a year are spent with a health professional so ensuring everyone with diabetes can self-manage is critical.
Everyone with diabetes can benefit from self-management education and support to give them the skills to understand and manage their diabetes. This may involve attending a youth camp for children with type 1 diabetes or one of the state-wide DESMOND groups for people with type 2 diabetes.
DESMOND is great example of collaboration on a global level. This evidence-based type 2 diabetes program, developed at the University of Leicester, helps participants raise their knowledge and understanding of what diabetes means for them and how self-management best works for them. The program is delivered through Australia, and in Tasmania Diabetes Tasmania is a licensed provider, delivering the service state-wide in cities and regions.
For those who participate in DESMOND, Shop Well, Eat Well or the COACH Program, the feedback has been positive - for some it has literally been life changing.
Diabetes Tasmania delivers services to 18 Tasmanians a day, but with 82,000 diagnosed with diabetes or living with the disease but undiagnosed or at high risk, this is the tip of an iceberg. Many times people have said to me: ""I just manage with a tablet"" or ""I watch what I eat"" or ""I don't have the serious one, so I don't need to worry"".
Diabetes is a serious and progressive disease. Making sure everyone living with diabetes fully understands their condition, has information, and is assisted to become more engaged in managing their own health is paramount. This is a key challenge faced by diabetes organisations the world over.
One area where we differ from other countries is a funded scheme to support people with diabetes. The National Diabetes Services Scheme has been in place in Australia since 1987, funded by federal governments, and ensures all those with diabetes in Australia have access to heavily subsidised product and free health education services to help them to self-manage. If you have diabetes, you need to be registered on the NDSS, see your GP or contact Diabetes Tasmania on 1300 136 588.
Another area discussed was that of research, and the common theme for both of our countries is that funding for research is at a crossroad, lagging other disease groups.
The National Health and Medical Research Council reported a $12 million reduction in expenditure in Australia from 2011 to 2015. This seems incongruous as one of the goals of the National Diabetes Strategy argued the case for strengthening prevention and management of diabetes through research. As advocacy groups, we are pushing the case for more funding.
The area of prevention is one where both our countries face huge challenges. We know we can help prevent people developing type 2 diabetes through behavioural-change initiatives and measures like reducing sugar and saturated fat in food.
In the UK, the NHS Diabetes Prevention Program, a collaboration between the NHS, Public Health England and Diabetes UK is making inroads in reducing the level of risk for people with diabetes.
In Australia we have prevention programs in place in Victoria and Queensland, funded by state health departments.
Diabetes Tasmania has been advocating locally for the implementation of similar evidence-based prevention programs, as has Diabetes Australia nationally.
We are yet to see this happen, despite the fact that the National Diabetes Strategy states that preventing people developing type 2 diabetes is the number-one goal.
Caroline Wells is the chief executive of Diabetes Tasmania.

Two very different types of diabetes 
THE incidence of type 1 diabetes is on the rise, and although not as commonly diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, data suggests incidence of type 1 diabetes worldwide is increasing by 2-5 per cent per year.
Accounting for about 10% of all diabetes cases, people with type 1 diabetes are a minority within the diabetes population, and this may be a reason the condition is misunderstood.
Described as an auto-immune condition, type 1 diabetes is different to type 2 and occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
Management involves daily insulin injections or an insulin pump; a small computerised device that delivers a continuous supply of insulin. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented and currently there is no cure.
Its cause is not entirely understood; genetics and environmental factors are believed to be involved. Its onset has nothing to do with eating too many sugary foods or lack of exercise.
Type 1 diabetes can affect both children and adults although more than half of cases arise in childhood or adolescence. Onset is usually sudden. Type 1 diabetes is not contagious and cannot be caught from another person. People with type 1 diabetes should follow normal healthy eating guidelines. No food is out of bounds but like people without diabetes, too many sugary foods are not recommended.

Smart ink tatts for health
WE have heard about the good oil, but how about the good ink? Harvard and MIT researchers have turned body art into medical technology by developing tattoo ink capable of monitoring health.
The smart ink changes colour if the wearer is dehydrated or if blood sugars rise and fall in diabetics.
The biosensitive inks, developed at Harvard, have combined with traditional tattoo artistry as a way to overcome some of the limitations of current biomedical monitoring devices, which are battery dependent.
""We were thinking: New technologies, what is the next generation after wearables?"" co-developer Dr Ali Yetisen, of Harvard, said. ""We came up with the idea that we could incorporate biosensors in the skin."" Current wearable medical devices like fobs and wrist bands were not ""seamlessly integrated with the body"" Dr Yetisen said. The ""Dermal Abyss"" tattoo inks change colour according to the chemistry of the body's interstitial fluid. Inks developed so far change from green to brown as glucose concentration increases.

Some handy steps for keeping your feet neat
CARING for the feet is particularly important for people with diabetes. If changes to the feet go unnoticed, they can lead to serious complications. Changes can present as reduced blood supply to the legs and feet (peripheral vascular disease) or nerve damage to the feet (diabetic neuropathy).
Peripheral vascular disease is often caused by narrowing of blood vessels, leading to poor blood flow to the area. It may take longer for cuts, sores and infections to heal due to inadequate blood flow. Death of tissue and skin around the infected area increases the risk of leg ulcers and gangrene.
Symptoms of poor blood flow to the feet may be pain or cramping in the backs of the legs, particularly when walking. Narrowing of blood vessels can be caused by such things as elevated blood glucose levels, smoking and high blood lipids.
Ways to improve blood flow to the feet include managing blood lipids and blood glucose levels, exercising daily and not smoking. Diabetic neuropathy occurs when nerves are damaged by high blood glucose levels over an extended period of time. Symptoms may include burning, tingling and pain in the feet, particularly at night. There may also be a lack of feeling in the feet, making detecting pain, heat or cold in the foot more challenging. Consequently, there is an increased risk of cuts, burns or blisters, which may lead to infection and ulcers. All people with diabetes should have their feet checked once or twice a year by a podiatrist.
Other things that can be done at home include daily feet checks for signs of swelling, bruising, blisters, redness or heat, drying well between the toes, moisturising dry skin, especially cracked heels, wearing appropriate shoes, never going barefoot, avoiding tight socks or stockings with prominent seams, keeping toenails trimmed and having corns or calluses treated by a podiatrist. See your doctor if there is development of pain, throbbing, heat, swelling or discolouration in the feet, or a cut or injury that becomes red or does not heal.

Patients at risk of drug switches
HUNDREDS of thousands of patients could be at risk of anaphylaxis, blood clots and medicine failure now that chemists can switch their biologic medicines, doctors warn.
These very expensive medicines are used to treat arthritis, diabetes, cancer, Crohn's disease and psoriasis.
In the coming months cheaper versions of these medicines - called biosimilars - will come onto the Australian market. While these medicines are safe, there are concerns that switching between different brands may pose risks, and doctors say it should only be done strictly under medical supervision.
The Government stands to save $880 million if it can shift patients onto the cheaper drugs, which are similar but not exactly the same, allowing other breakthrough medicines to be funded.
It wants to speed up that shift and this week changed legislation to allow a chemist to switch the medicine when a patient presents a script, in the same way they can substitute cheaper generic drugs.
Before chemists can make the switch, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee must decide if it is safe to do so.
However in making that decision, the PBAC says it will have a default position of allowing substitution and consider any absence of data about safety issues or efficacy problems with the drugs as relevant issues.
""This shift in the burden of proof is concerning. Medicines should not be subject to considerations that rely on the absence of data to prove their safety or efficacy,"" Diabetes Australia told a Senate committee.
""This has the potential to impact over 365,000 Australians currently using insulin to manage their diabetes,"" it said.
Doctors can prevent any substitution by ticking a ""do not substitute"" box on the script, and patients can tell their chemist they don't want to switch brands.
The substitution policy has caused outrage and concern among medical specialists, consumer groups, and even the drug companies that stand to profit from selling cheaper biosimilar medicines.
Health Minister Sussan Ley says the Abbott Government remains committed to accepting the advice of the independent PBAC.
Dr Paul Kubler, the director of clinical pharmacology and rheumatology at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, says constantly switching patients between versions of these drugs could overstimulate their immune systems. As a result, the patient could suffer anaphylaxis, lung or leg blood clots, or their body may produce antibodies against the medicine, which could then stop working.

GEN Y LOSE BATTLE OF THE BULGE
DOOMSAYERS in the '90s predicted a grim future for the children caught in the grip of an obesity explosion. And as the last Gen Ys hit 20 this year, the health report is in and it's not pretty.
Infertility rates, weight-related cancers and chronic diabetes-related conditions have soared in Queenslanders aged 20 to 29 - showing that this may well be the generation outlived by their parents.
The Australian Medical Association's Queensland president Shaun Rudd admits he sometimes feels powerless as to how to help severely overweight young people.
""I see patients that are so morbidly obese that they are difficult to help. They have multiple problems and are often unable to physically move. They have big ulcers on their legs. It is very demoralising and depressing as it is hard to know how to help,"" he said.
David Molloy from the Queensland Fertility Group is concerned by the big surge in women in their 20s who are infertile due to being obese throughout childhood.
""We are starting to see the problems develop that we knew were coming. There are often problems with ovulation in very overweight women,"" he said.
According to the Cancer Council Queensland the rate of obesity-related cancer among 20-29 year olds has been increasing in Queensland since 1982.
Trend analyses show the incidence rate increasing by 2.8 per cent each year, which equates to a 129 per cent spike between 1982 and 2012.
Katie Clift from the Cancer Council said there is evidence that being overweight and obese increases the risk of developing cancers of the bowel, oesophagus, pancreas, kidney, endometrium, ovaries, gallbladder and thyroid."" In 2004 there were 703 people registered on the National Diabetes Services Scheme with type 2 diabetes. By 2014, that number had increased to 1111, an increase of 63 per cent.
Diabetes Queensland believes the number of 20-29 year olds living with type 2 diabetes, either diagnosed or undiagnosed, or at high risk of the condition, is significantly higher. ""We are particularly concerned with evidence indicating current Gen Ys may be the first generation to experience shorter life expectancy than their parents,"" CEO Michelle Trute said.

Diet drinks a fizzer: study
A DIET soft drink a day could be making you fat, more likely to get diabetes and at greater risk of cardiovascular disease.
Artificial sweeteners used in these drinks are meant to give the taste without the calories but a review of scientific studies suggests they may interfere with the body's normal energy regulation.
Researcher Susan Swithers, of Purdue University in the US, said sweet tastes normally triggered a psychological response which signalled the arrival of nutrients in the stomach.
However, research shows when artificial sweeteners are consumed, no such energy burst follows and over time this appears to weaken the body's response to a sweet taste.
""By weakening the validity of sweet taste as a signal for caloric post-ingestive outcomes, consumption of artificial sweeteners could impair energy and body weight regulation,"" she said in a paper published today in Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism.
The research looks at 15 health studies from around the world that included data on artificial sweetener consumption over the past 40 years.
The clear conclusion was there was ""little support for artificially sweetened beverages in promoting weight loss or preventing negative health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome (increased blood pressure, high fasting blood glucose, large waist circumference, high cholesterol), and cardiovascular events,"" the study said.
Instead, several of the studies suggested that people who regularly consumed artificially sweetened beverages were at increased risk.
The San Antonio Heart study of 1250 men and women found risk of weight gain and obesity were greater in those consuming artificially sweetened beverages.
A European study of more than 66,000 women and a health professionals' study of about 40,000 men found the risk of type 2 diabetes doubled for heavy drinkers of artificially sweetened beverages.
The Nurses Health Study, which included more than 88,000 women, found the risk for type 2 diabetes was increased by consuming only one artificially sweetened beverage a day.
A separate study of overweight and obese adults who substituted water or artificially sweetened drinks for sugar-sweetened beverages found while there was an improvement in blood sugar levels in those consuming water, no such effect happened in those consuming artificially sweetened beverages.
The study comes as new research shows increasing exercise rates in the US have not helped cull rising obesity rates.
Obesity rates increased across the US from 2001 to 2009 despite a rise in the prevalence of physical activity.

Weighing up the benefits of gastric banding
Every time Brian Henry moves a 20-kilogram bag of firewood, the same thought crosses his mind. The chunks of redgum are a reminder of what he has lost. And he couldn't be happier - or healthier.
After being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes in 2009, the 64-year-old grandfather slimmed down, dropping 20 kilograms in the 12 months following gastric band surgery.
Mr Henry can again fit into the pants he wore when he met his wife 20 years ago. And he has a lot more energy - handy when you have eight grandchildren.
But the best thing of all is that his diabetes has gone into remission, meaning he can throw away his insulin, with which he had to inject himself daily. ""I never got used to having to pierce my body with a sharp implement; it was a strange feeling,"" he said.
Mr Henry participated in a long-term Monash University study looking at whether moderately overweight people with type-2 diabetes would benefit from gastric band surgery.
Previous studies have looked at the benefits for obese people with a body mass index of 35 or above, but the five-year research by Monash's Centre for Obesity Research and Education looked at those with a BMI of between 25 and 30.
The findings, published in the journal Diabetes Care, suggest the current guidelines - which say surgery should be reserved for people with a BMI in excess of 35 - should be revised.
Led by endocrinologist John Wentworth and weight loss surgeon Paul O'Brien, the research showed gastric band surgery significantly reduced health risks for overweight people with type-2 diabetes.
Almost a quarter of participants who had surgery had their diabetes go into remission within five years.
In the control group of type-2 diabetes patients considered overweight, just 9 per cent had their diabetes go into remission.
Participants who had gastric band surgery reported an average weight loss of 12.2 per cent of body weight, compared with 1.8 per cent in the control group.
""Even if you are mildly overweight, substantial weight loss is going to deliver significant health benefits,"" Dr Wentworth said.
He said that while changes to diet and exercise should be the first port of call for those trying to lose weight, the benefits of surgery should not be overlooked.
""If someone wants to do it, this is pretty good evidence to suggest it is worthwhile,"" he said.
The average cost of the gastric band surgery and aftercare is $13,910, but those who no longer require diabetes medication would save an average of about $4260.
Conducted between 2009 and 2016, the research found some patients experienced adverse side effects. Three had transient difficulty with swallowing and two needed revision surgery. However, they were in the minority.
Dr Wentworth said that while it was a small study, involving 45 people at the five-year mark and 48 at the two-year mark, he expected the results would translate on a larger scale.
For Mr Henry, the experience has been a positive one. While he misses eating steak - ""I'm a chicken and fish person now"" - he knows it's a small price to pay.
""You do lose some things, but the gain is your health,"" he said.

Pace quickens over diabetes 
Health - Mesoblast trials promising
Promising research data will prompt Australian-based regenerative medicine company Mesoblast to expedite a new round of more advanced clinical trials for a potential treatment for complications arising from diabetes.
""We couldn't have hoped for a better outcome,"" Mesoblast founder Professor Silviu Itescu said of the trial results.
""We met the primary end point"" of the research program.
Mesoblast said a phase II clinical trial of patients with diabetic nephropathy involving a single injection of its MPC-300-IV, an allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cell, was not only safe but reduced damaging inflammation and helped preserve or improve renal function of the kidney over at least a 24-week period.
""The numbers were quite substantial,"" Professor Itescu said of the research results.
""We 're looking at ways to accelerate the research program,"" he said, with trials across a larger patient base to validate the results.
""We can now target the sickest portion of the population.""
Diabetic nephropathy affects as many as half of all patients with type-2 diabetes, with a progressive decline in kidney function, which is resulting in a steep rise in the demand for kidney dialysis.
""There has been a fivefold increase in the numbers on dialysis in Australia since the late 1990s,"" Professor Itescu said.
""It is an exploding epidemic. Diabetic kidney disease is the No. 1 cause of end-stage renal failure - it occurs in as many as 50 per cent of all cases. Drugs can control the disease but more than 40 per cent of those with diabetes end up with kidney failure.""
Existing treatments cannot address the renal failure, which has prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to encourage any treatment which can help to slow the decline in renal failure.
In its research trial, 30 patients were evaluated in a double-blind, random, placebo-controlled dose escalating trial, receiving a dose of Mesoblast's MPC-300-IV candidate.
Along with safety, the trial was aimed at demonstrating the effect of the MPC treatment in improving renal function. The research trial demonstrated safety as well as improved renal function.
""The results show that Mesoblast's allogeneic cell therapy was safe and may be particularly useful in patients with moderate to severe diabetic nephropathy, a disease which, despite all existing therapies, continues to have a high rate of progression to dialysis or transplantation, and to portent a high risk of death from cardiovascular disease,"" the trial's lead investigator, clinical associate professor David Packham, of the University of Melbourne's Department of Medicine, said. He is also director of the Melbourne Renal Research Group.
In the US alone, there are more than 20 million sufferers of diabetes, of which more than 6 million new patients are expected to develop diabetic nephropathy. Because of a shortage of kidneys, it is estimated more than 90,000 people died while waiting for transplants in the US in 2012, while 40 per cent of those on dialysis die within two years.

Emma hopes testing routine will end
DARWIN schoolgirl Emma Foster, 10, was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) just two years ago but she hasn't given up hope that a cure for the chronic condition will soon be found.
T1D is an unpreventable, life-long auto-immune disease that destroys the body's ability to produce insulin.
Insulin allows the body to process sugar to create energy. Without insulin, the body starves as it cannot process food.
The cause of T1D is not yet understood. Emma said she first started realising something was wrong when she was constantly hungry.
""I had 16 Weet-Bix for breakfast one day,"" she said.
Emma's mother Tarin Foster, 33, is a nurse and said she figured out what the problem was ""fairly quickly"".
""My husband is a doctor so we knew the symptoms of T1D,"" she said.
""Diabetics typically drink a lot of water because they're always thirsty.""
Emma's condition is now controlled with a daily regimen of between six and eight finger-prick blood tests and a continuous infusion of insulin through a pump.
But the routine which keeps her alive has had an impact on Emma's life.
""It's sad to see her lose her freedom,"" Tarin said.
""She will always need someone with her who knows what to do when she has a hypo.""
Emma described T1D as annoying. ""I can't go to a party and just eat the food, I have to do a test before everything,"" Emma said.

Diabetes goes west
HOSPITAL admissions due to type 2 diabetes are growing in Victoria, and nowhere more so than in Melbourne's west.
Claims figures released by health insurer Medibank Private for Diabetes Week show 1189 such admissions from western suburbs residents last year, up from 930 in 2013 - an increase of 28 per cent.
This compares with a state-wide increase of 12 per cent.
And separate analysis by weight-loss company Jenny Craig flagged Altona Meadows, Hoppers Crossing and Werribee as Victoria's areas of greatest concern for women at risk of developing diabetes.
According to Medibank's figures, all areas showed a rise in type 2 diabetes admissions, but central Melbourne had the lowest, at 6 per cent.
Medibank chief medical officer Dr Linda Swan said it was important to identify diabetes hot spots so the locals could be encouraged to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.
""While the overall increase in admissions over time in Victoria is smaller than in other states, what's concerning is that Melbourne's western suburbs are in fact seeing one of the highest rates of increase nationally,"" Dr Swan said.
But according to a report commissioned by Jenny Craig, some exclusive leafy suburbs are gaining on those in the outer west. Its analysis of Body Mass Index measurements and attitudes to diabetes flagged the highest concerns for women in the west, but identified Toorak and Kew as having overweight locals at risk.
The report, based on an analysis by Salmat of a 32,000-person Australian Bureau of Statistics health survey, combined with Nielsen and Roy Morgan poll findings, showed Berwick had the highest concentration of middle-aged females with a high BMI worried about their diabetes risk.
It found those in Moonee Ponds, Cheltenham, Frankston, Greensborough and Knox paid most attention to their diets, to avoid the risk.
GP Sarah Latreille said: ""This data reveals people are worried about the serious health risks carrying extra kilos can have, but the real question is, what are they doing about it?""

Diabetes courses caught in RTO blitz
A string of registered training organisations has been caught up in a Victorian government probe into the provision of diabetes courses, with at least five providers having funding contracts cancelled or suspended.
The crackdown on certificate-level diabetes courses comes amid a wider operation announced last week, when Victoria's Training and Skills Minister Steve Herbert said a significant number of the state's 500 RTOs would be audited after a preliminary investigation found widespread rorting.
The review of diabetes courses relates to concerns regarding training that has not been delivered, unapproved third-party arrangements, and incentives being offered to students, according to a Victorian Department of Education and Training spokesman.
The DEECD has already suspended payments made under a 2014 funding contract with Consider This Training and suspended payments for a similar course offered by the Australian Management Authority, both owned by the ASX-listed Australian Careers Network.
New enrolments also have been suspended pending the investigation. The DEECD spokesman declined to provide further information, citing the ongoing review, but said it would not affect any continuing students. It's understood all five RTOs funded through the Victorian government have had some or all of their funding suspended for diabetes certificates.
Several other providers, who are not funded through the Victorian government, have quietly removed the course from their website. A significant proportion of the concerns centre on the practice of sponsorship or ""rebates"" paid to local community and sporting clubs in exchange for the enrolment of their members.
One sponsorship proposal seen by the HES said ""it is in the best financial interests of the association to encourage as many member enrolments as possible"". The proposal, which could not be verified, suggested a $400 per student rebate for enrolments into the diabetes training courses.
HES understands the DEECD became alarmed at the rapid increase in enrolments for the diabetes courses, with student numbers rising from zero to several hundred within a year.
However, some RTOs said the government had to appear to be doing something, having already indicated it would move on several providers.
The increased pace of regulatory intervention comes after a state government review of quality assurance in Victoria's vocational education and training system, with all 19 recommendations accepted by Mr Herbert.
""To support the implementation of the review's recommendations, a blitz is presently under way targeting providers that breach the terms of their funding contracts,"" a spokesman for Mr Herbert said.
""The state government has made it clear that there is no place for providers who take advantage of students, that's why we have launched a $9 million review to crack down on dodgy training providers."" The investigation has seen red flags raised on more than 50 providers and uncovered evidence of dodgy colleges trawling Centrelink offices to lure trainees with false promises of job-ready training and incentives such as free iPads.
Some firms in the sector are operating purely as aggregators, with some using fake job ads to compile leads that are then sold to colleges for the actual training.
Concerns arose more than a year ago with the issues raised by the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority about Vocation-owned BAWM and Aspin, with 2409 of 6000 qualifications granted by BAWM recalled. Since then there have been further qualification recalls.
The intense compliance campaign in Victoria follows the introduction of the final tranche of regulation at the federal level, where most RTOs are registered, preventing course fees from being charged upfront and forcing the publication of third-party agents and brokers on provider websites.
The government intends to amend the Higher Education Support Act, the relevant legislation, later this year. Advice prepared by the department shows it expects the changes to affect most providers, particularly provisions about teaching periods and the timing of fee charges.

Deb giving diabetics hope
HOBART mother Deb Ludeke is helping give fellow diabetics a new lease on life. Ms Ludeke is a type 1 diabetic and the director of Paced, a diabetes charity group.
Paced has just secured $2000 from the Premier's Discretionary Fund to help kick-start a program that will rollout free Medtronic insulin pumps to Tasmanian diabetics.
The pumps monitor blood sugar and inject glucose.
Including a glucose monitoring package, they cost about $12,500 each. Ms Ludeke said the pumps would be free for Tasmanians because Paced had established a sponsorship agreement with Medtronic, which would help subsidise ""hundreds"" of devices.  She said the Government's $2000 as well as fundraisers, donations, grants and corporate events would make up the difference.
The initiative is only available for people most in need, based on clinical advice, or for those who cannot afford the pumps. Previously the devices were only available for those with private health insurance, which Ms Ludeke said wasn't always feasible due to costs.
She said the group began taking applications from Tasmanians last night. Patients will be short-listed based on needs, with the rollout to start in due course.
""We have had over 600 people inquire, so we can now also launch nationally and start funding pumps Australia- wide,"" she said.
""The first pumps will go to Tasmanians as there are about 3000 people in Tasmania with type 1 diabetes."" Ms Ludeke has endured ongoing issues with low blood sugar levels. Before she discovered the pump, her son Lachlan would have to call an ambulance two to three times a week after finding his mum unconscious in bed because of her blood sugar levels dropping.

Leap of faith in insulin device
In a world first, WA teenagers with type 1 diabetes are testing the most advanced artificial pancreas in their everyday life.
Until now the latest closed-loop insulin delivery technology, which does the job of the pancreas in releasing insulin to keep blood sugar levels stable, has been used only in hospitals where patients could be monitored.
But researchers from the Telethon Kids Institute and Princess Margaret Hospital took a dozen teenagers aged 13 to 17 on a camp to Woodman Point this week to test it in real life.
It is hoped the updated device will improve the quality of life of children with type 1 diabetes and reduce the demands on their parents who sometimes have to get up several times a night to test levels and administer insulin.
While type 2 diabetes is considered a largely preventable, lifestyle condition, type 1 is an autoimmune disease and often requires injections of insulin with a syringe or pump to maintain blood sugar levels.
In WA, there are more than 1200 families who have children with type 1 diabetes.
PMH paediatric endocrinologist Martin de Bock, who is heading the group trial, said the next-generation insulin delivery system had been refined just as smartphones had evolved and become easier to use.
""The technology used to be a bit clunky, but improvements have been made so it's more user-friendly, and it's getting smarter and more reactive,"" Dr de Bock said. ""It's less burdensome, which is really critical in this age group because teenagers just want to be able to get out and do their thing.
""On this camp we've been putting the technology through its paces, but the activities have been very unstructured.
""These young people have been jumping off the pier, getting around on bikes and just having fun.""
Dr de Bock said the trial was likely to help move a step closer to a fully automated artificial pancreas system.

Diabetes education reaches out to bush
A national type-1 diabetes database, which previously targeted children in capital cities, will soon reach out to regional Australia and adults in the hope more can be learned about a disease that costs the country as much as $14 billion each year.
The Turnbull government will spend $4 million to expand the diabetes database through the Australasian Diabetes Data Network and support two career development awards aimed at inspiring experts in the field to carry out potentially life-changing research.
Education and Training Minister Simon Birmingham said the first $2m would help the database expand beyond the current 6000 registered type-1 child patients and give researchers a national understanding of the disease to improve patient outcomes.
For Sydney father Josh Moyes, ready access to support and information through the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation proved invaluable when his daughter Zoe was diagnosed with the disease at age three.
At first he feared a bleak future but seven years later, ground-breaking research and medicine are allowing his daughter, now an active 10-year-old, to live the life he had always imagined for her.
He told The Australian yesterday that while the early days of diagnosis were daunting, he had since learned that even if a cure for the disease was never found, successful management, critical to the normality of his daughter's life, could be ""the equivalent"".
Already, with the help of an insulin pump and having mastered matching her carb intake with her insulin levels, Zoe can attend school camps, play in a band and eat cupcakes at friends' birthday parties if she wants to.
Mr Moyes said much was known about the disease but it was now a matter of ""pulling it all together"".
""With all the research that is going into this... there is so much prospect of a breakthrough,"" he said.
""It all feels like we're on the cusp of something... I hope that by the time Zoe is an adult, we will have a cure or something close, like an artificial replacement (for insulin)... I think it's a very realistic thing to look forward to in the early part of her life."" Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation chief executive Mike Wilson said the data network helped researchers identify people with type-1 diabetes who were eligible for clinical trials and would also allow for formal links to be forged with similar registries around the world.

Nose for trouble makes Molly perfect pet for twins
Identical twins Hannah and Olivia Weber, aged 7, have Type 1 Diabetes. They will attend Ainslie Primary School with terrier Molly, who detects changes in their blood-sugar levels. Photo: MELISSA ADAMS By John Thistleton
Identical twins Hannah and Olivia Weber can take their little terrier Molly to school every day, from Monday. They love Molly. Their mother, Adrienne Collett, picked her out from a litter in 2013, knowing how loyal and resilient Australian silky terriers are, and that they don't moult. When she saw Molly it seemed the puppy was saying: ""I want a cuddle, pick me up."" ""She reminds me of Pollyanna, every day with her is a glad day,"" Ms Collett said. ""She is a bit of a tart, she'll go to anybody."" When Hannah, a type 1 diabetic, was two, she frightened Ms Collett when her blood glucose levels went up and she was admitted to hospital. Olivia came to the rescue then, willing her twin sister to regain consciousness and pleading, ""I love you Hannah, please wake up."" Now both girls have the disease and suffer from severe anxiety. Ms Collett needed help, but said PAWS Diabetic Assistance Dogs in Brisbane would not allow the children to have a dog, so she approached the Guide Dogs to help train one and found Molly. A diabetic alert dog university in the United States has also helped. Molly is being trained to respond to the girls' abnormal blood sugar levels by smelling a swab of their spittle. She passed a crucial test last November. Hannah's blood glucose levels and dangerous ketone chemicals were so high her little body was beginning to break down. Molly bolted for Ms Collett's bedroom, but she was in such a slumber she mumbled: ""Go away."" Molly wouldn't. Whimpering, she jumped on her bed, paced backwards and forwards, and raced from bedroom to bedroom until the alarm was raised. An ambulance was called and tragedy avoided. When they play on the polished floor at home, Molly disappears into a tangle of the twins' long blonde hair as they fuss over her. ""Who is the good Molly? Who is the good Molly,"" Hannah says. In a note to the Ainslie School's year two teachers, where Molly is headed on Monday, Ms Collett raised her daughters debilitating anxiety: ""You have watched them struggle with their conditions and sometimes their inability to always conform to normal. They have insight into their brain not doing what they want to, and cry about it when they get home. Thank you for being so open and allowing this opportunity."" The family moved from Brisbane to Canberra for schooling. In a new city Ms Collett spotted a magnet on a car door in her neighbourhood: ""Dogs on the Run"" which led her to Carolyn Kidd and Barb Bundy. At that stage Molly was still learning the basics, so the dog trainers stepped in with obedience training and socialising. Ms Kidd said: ""The more we got to know Adrienne and realised what was going on with her family we all got involved in the 'Mind Dog' training, in terms of taking Molly to cafes, doctors' surgeries, so she would get used to being in different environments, being calm, really well behaved."" Ms Collett will miss Molly at school time and says sending her off with the twins is like sending her and her partner Martin's third child to school. While people are not supposed to pat Mind Dogs, Ms Collett says the children at school will be an exception, because they have to bond. ""We want them to accept her and if that means they have to touch her, so be it. The biggest hurdle we have faced is people refusing her access to places because she is not a labrador.""

Fat waists 'toxic' for women
CELLULITE might be a woman's worst enemy but medical experts believe it could be their best friend in fighting off chronic illness.
Researchers have discovered people with fat in their lower body (pear-shaped bodies) are at lower risk of developing diabetes or heart disease than those who carry ""toxic"" fat around or above their waist (apple shaped).
And women who get liposuction have been revealed to have increased risk of chronic illness because the fat they eat becomes stored around the liver and other organs.
""Fat stored on the hips is a good thing because it protects organs like the liver from becoming fatty,"" Westmead Millennium Institute senior research fellow Dr Michael Swarbrick said.
""There is also research that suggests that it helps with good hormones and has anti-inflammatory factors.
""That upper body fat tends to get inflamed and that exacerbates heart disease and diabetes,"" Dr Swarbrick said.
"" Fat around your gut and around the organs is particularly toxic."" The joint Garvan and Millennium Institute study fed mice a junk food diet for at least six weeks.
Dr Swarbrick said more sit-ups and less squats in the gym was ""probably the way to go"".
""If you are going to focus on weight loss it should be targeting that weight around the tummy and the abdominal organs,"" he said.
""By getting a GP to measure their waist and hips they can get a really easy index of their risk of diabetes or having a heart attack."" Diabetes in Western Sydney will increase by 175 per cent in the next decade, according to Western Sydney Diabetes Prevention and Management.

Jayne Ross AGE: 40 TYPE 1 DIABETES 
For years Jayne Ross tried to ignore the fact she had type 1 diabetes, only taking the bare minimum of insulin she needed to get through the day.
But that period of uncontrolled diabetes has come back to haunt her in the form of an amputation and kidney problems so serious she is now on the waiting list for a transplant.
Were she able to go back, Ms Ross, now 40, said she would tell her 15-year-old self to pay attention to her condition and manage it well.
Just 11 when she was diagnosed, poor family support and a lack of understanding about diabetes meant she was left to manage on her own. From day one she did her blood sugar tests and insulin injections.
""I was sort of left to my own devices from a young age having to deal with it and I didn't take it very seriously,"" she said.
A visit to hospital when she was 14 was a turning point. It was there she learnt from other teens with diabetes how to make herself sick to get time off school and how to take just enough insulin to get by but not enough so she would put on weight.
""When you're a teenager you think you're invincible... you know you are going to get old but you don't think 'I'm going to lose my leg',"" Ms Ross said.
""I just wanted to be like all my friends, they could go out and eat what they wanted to eat and do what they wanted to do, so I just said I'm not really diabetic, I'd just take enough insulin to get me through the day, barely took my blood sugars and did a lot of fairly stupid things.""
From her early 20s, Ms Ross had slightly better control of her condition but it was not until she got an insulin pump at 28 and decided she wanted to have children that she finally took it seriously.
By then though the damage had already been done, Ms Ross underwent a number of laser treatments on her eyes to correct damage to vessels caused by long periods of high blood sugars. Just before she fell pregnant with her first child, Ms Ross began having issues with her feet - ulcers that would not heal because of poor circulation related to vascular disease.
What started out as a small ulcer on a toe on her left foot, seven years later led to limb damage so severe she eventually had to relent to doctors' advice and have her left leg amputated below the knee.
""It just got to a point where, after having kids and all the complications of that, that they said my kidneys were really struggling,"" she said. ""The doctors said if I had to have another round of antibiotics my kidneys would probably go into failure and I'd have to go on dialysis, so it was dialysis or the leg.
""It took me a long time to accept it but I thought I have to do it to make myself better. My youngest boy is six now but he was only 15 months when I went through the amputation surgery so it wasn't very easy but I have learnt to deal with it. I know it is all caused by things that I did when I was young and silly and didn't look after myself. I don't say I blame myself but if there's anyone to be angry at for the position I'm in it's me.""
Ms Ross believes it was the lack of family support when she was young that let her down and is now a strong advocate for supporting young people with diabetes, telling her story to drive home the serious consequences of mismanaging the condition.
'It took me a long time to accept it but I thought I have to do it to make myself better. My youngest boy is six now but he was only 15 months when I went through the amputation surgery so it wasn't very easy but I have learnt to deal with it.

Diabetes check is a life saver
NOT enough Tasmanians are being tested for diabetes and Ron Cruickshank has a message for those showing even the slightest sign of the condition - get checked today.
To mark National Diabetes Awareness Week, Diabetes Tasmania has launched a regional campaign to encourage Tasmanians to get checked for type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes Tasmania chief executive Caroline Wells said up to 712 people in Hobart could be living with ""silent"", undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.
The ""It's About Time"" campaign follows new research that found while more than 60 per cent of Australians had risk factors for type 2 diabetes, only 5 per cent of people aged over 40 had had a check in the past two years.
More than 51 per cent of people surveyed were unable to name any diabetes-related complication despite type 2 diabetes being a leading cause of vision loss, kidney damage, heart attacks, stroke and limb amputation.
Ms Wells said damage caused by diabetes was preventable and encouraged Tasmanians to get checked.
""Many people live with type 2 diabetes for up to seven years before being diagnosed,"" she said.
""During that time, up to half begin to develop a diabetes-related complication like vision loss, kidney damage, heart attacks, stroke and limb amputation."" Mr Cruickshank was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2009 after he began feeling lethargic and constantly thirsty. ""If you have any family history, are overweight, tired or thirsty, go talk to your doctor,"" he said.

Good job
THE JOB
I'm the priority populations unit manager at Diabetes WA. I look after a variety of projects that aim to reduce the impact of diabetes in high-risk populations, such as Aboriginal communities, culturally and linguistically diverse groups and people living in rural and remote areas of WA.
THE PATH
After graduating from high school, I completed a bachelor of health science, majoring in public health and human geography. Once I completed my degree, I worked in a couple of different roles and eventually took a position as a health promotion officer at Diabetes WA. I then worked my way into this management role.
THE GOOD
Seeing and hearing the positive impacts of our work on people at risk of, or living with, diabetes. One of our most successful community advocates lost almost 40kg with the help of Diabetes WA. I also really enjoy getting the opportunity to meet the amazing people who call remote WA home.
THE BAD
The work of Diabetes WA and other not-for-profit organisations is reliant on funding, which can be uncertain. This means a level of job insecurity but also our projects are often short-term and not as sustainable as we would like.
THE FUTURE
I hope to continue to work in health promotion, particularly with communities where there are significant health inequities to be addressed.

Western Sydney: diabetes 'danger zone'
The diabetes epidemic has gripped western Sydney, with Liverpool topping the list of suburbs with the highest number of people suffering from the disease.
Research released on Monday by the Australian Diabetes Council shows that of the 10 ""hot spot"" suburbs, seven are in Sydney's west.
""No matter how we look at it, regardless of age, gender and type, western Sydney is the danger zone,"" said the council's head researcher, Alan Barclay.
Liverpool is followed by Mount Druitt, Campbelltown, Westmead and Blacktown. The concentration was largely due to different ethnic groups, poor diet and lower levels of education, Dr Barclay said.
Improved primary health care was needed to prevent it, he said, with more skilled health professionals, educators and dietitians required per capita.
""People need to know more about food and how to prepare it. We have to start doing more in schools and in the local community,"" he said.
Overall the number of people with diabetes is on the rise: 5.6 per cent of the NSW population had diabetes in 2011, up from 4.8 per cent in 2006. One person is diagnosed every five minutes. Obesity rates are also soaring, with statistics showing the number of obese people has doubled in 30 years.
Dr Barclay said diabetes was common in people from Mediterranean, Asian, Middle Eastern, Pacific Island and indigenous Australian backgrounds: ""All of these groups are much more likely to get type 2 diabetes.""
Indigenous Australians were the most vulnerable. ""They are three times more likely to get diabetes than a Caucasian person,"" he said.
People who had a high mortgage relative to their income and those who spent hours driving to and from work were at greater risk, he said. ""Less spare time is linked to a limited ability to prepare meals and increased chance of buying takeaway food. Those foods are high in saturated fat, kilojoules and have a high glycaemic load which makes people prone to diabetes.""
The research said one in two Australians feel the government could do more to help them manage the disease. The cost of treating someone with complications is more than $16,000 a year.
""The cost will only grow if we don't act now,"" said Nicola Stokes, the council's chief executive.

Strike force faces more investigations into deaths of elderly
Police investigating the suspicious deaths of at least two nursing home residents in Newcastle are being inundated with phone calls from worried relatives of other residents who have died while in care.
Strike Force Correa investigators are attempting to get on top of the massive workload that has confronted them since the deaths of Gwen Fowler, 83, and Ryan Kelly, 80, were deemed suspicious. The pair had been residents at the SummitCare Wallsend Sugarloaf Gardens home when they both became critically ill after being injected with high levels of insulin, despite not being diabetics.
Mrs Fowler was rushed to hospital on October 18 but died the following day, while Mr Kelly battled for more than a week before succumbing on October 29.
A third patient, 91-year-old Audrey Manuel, is still recovering after battling for two weeks to stay alive. Her level of dementia means she cannot assist police with how and by whom she was injected.
Fairfax Media revealed last week that the strike force was set up between local detectives and the homicide squad investigators after alert John Hunter Hospital staff identified the links and raised the alarm.
It was also revealed that detectives were set to reinvestigate other nursing home deaths amid fears there could be more victims.
Since the revelation, the strike force has been flooded with information from concerned relatives of other patients who have also died.
It is understood each inquiry will have to be looked at in some form by the strike force, increasing the workload in an already highly complex investigation.

Diabetes injection
DIABETICS on the waiting list for world-leading transplants to transform their quality of life will get them quicker under a new funding deal.
Victoria has become the host of the new national centre for islet cell transplantation.
The future of the treatment for type 1 diabetes has been in jeopardy for almost three years after Federal Government funding expired. Some patients have had to wait several years to access the program, but it now has $1 million from the State Government in recurring funding.
The procedure involves taking insulin-producing cells from deceased donor organs and injecting them into a patient's liver. It allows severe diabetics to produce insulin to the point that they can discard or reduce daily injections.
A total of 20 patients have received transplants from the partnership between St Vincent's Institute for Medical Research and St Vincent's Hospital.
Fundraising efforts by Susan Alberti and grants have kept the program afloat, but institute director Prof Tom Kay said this funding would ensure its continuation.
""Without this support, our program would have struggled to keep going,"" he said. Six patients with unstable diabetes will receive transplants shortly, giving them the chance to better control their blood glucose levels. Greg Stevenson, 65, has lived with type 1 diabetes for 40 years.
He has to check his blood up to 10 times a day and uses an insulin pump. ""I'm looking forward to being able to throw away my clock, my scales, stop carbohydrate counting and be able to eat a normal meal or wash the car without having a hypo and reduce the pressure on my family,"" he said.

A wine a day keeps doctor away
GOOD news for wine lovers: a new study has found that drinking ""little and often"" could lower the risk of diabetes.
The Danish study found men who drank three to four times a week cut their odds of type two diabetes by 27 per cent, compared with those who drank on less than one day a week. The reduction was almost a third for women.

It wasn't just good news for wine drinkers. The study also showed men who had just over nine pints of beer a week cut their odds of type 2 diabetes by 43 per cent compared with those who did not drink at all.
It's understood some parts of red wine grapes are believed to help control blood sugar. However, the study found binge-drinking could reverse the benefits by triggering weight gain. Unfortunately for spirit drinkers, gin and vodka almost doubled the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes at heart of the problem
THE horror heart attack days of the 1960s have returned, with a report warning Australians are headed for a renewed epidemic of heart disease fuelled by obesity and diabetes.
A combination of the two conditions, dubbed ""diabesity"", has led to a resurgence of heart disease as Australia's No.1 killer and wiped out many of the gains made to overcome spiralling rates of heart attacks and stroke in the past 50 years, the Baker IDI report said.
After decades of improvements, the number of heart disease deaths has flattened in the past five years and now appears to be reversing, with a rise in deaths this year for the first time in a decade.
With cardiovascular disease affecting more than 3.7 million Australians and accounting for 45,000 deaths a year, Baker IDI director Prof Tom Marwick warned cardiovascular complacency was a killer.
""The obesity epidemic is going to turn into more diabetes, and that is already happening,"" he said.
""The most common serious consequence of diabetes is cardiovascular, heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease.
""Back in the 1950-60s the frequency of type 2 diabetes was much less, and people had coronary disease from their smoking and stuff like that - that problem is less than what it was, but unfortunately the diabetes problem is more, and in addition to heart attacks and stroke it is going to drive a bunch of other things too."" In the past 50 years, life expectancy for Australians has risen by a decade, with 70 per cent attributed to fewer deaths from heart attacks, stroke and blood vessel diseases.
Despite being fit, a non-smoker and without a family history of heart disease, Andrew Ludecke of Melbourne was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat in 2011.
Cases of arterial fibrillation are projected to jump by 60 per cent in the next 15 years.
""It can hit anybody regardless of fitness, and regardless of age,"" he said. ""It's a big impact on my lifestyle, work obviously, but also the sports I play, and interacting with family and friends.""

Daily berry fix helps to ward off diabetes
Delicious fruits are the new weapon in the fight against obesity diseases
A HANDFUL of raspberries or a cup of blueberry juice daily is the latest weapon in the worldwide fight to address the rising tide of obesity-linked diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
The groundbreaking research announced this week at the World Horticultural Congress in Brisbane by Yves Desjardins, of Canada's Laval University, concludes that it is possible to lose 10 per cent of body weight and stop further weight gain overall by eating a handful of berries a day.
But the latest health boost offered by berries is not directly linked to their trendy ""antioxidant"" properties.
Instead, it is the ability of special polyphenol compounds found in high concentration in raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and cranberries to enhance the dominance of ""good"" stomach and gut bacteria that helps reduce obesity.
Professor Desjardins yesterday described the research as a ""paradigm shift"" in approaching diet-related diseases, showing that restoring bacterial balance in the gut through food choices was central to maintaining and restoring good health.
The research also showed that the good microflora in the gut encouraged by berries altered insulin sensitivity, staving off the onset of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes and similar diseases.
""When you are obese or have a bad 'McDonald's' diet, the dominant type of bacteria in your gut becomes quite nasty and releases fatty acids, which make you put on more weight, have a fatty, unhealthy liver and become more likely to develop diabetes and metabolic syndrome,"" Professor Desjardins said.
""If you want to become lean or healthy again, you need to restore the gut balance by encouraging another group of ""good"" microbacteria. What we have shown is that if you consume a small amount of berries constantly for a period of time you will find significant health benefits."" The research also showed that even people who persisted in eating a bad diet of a hamburger and cola a day - but who consumed a handful of berries or berry juice too - were unlikely to gain weight or develop diabetes as fast as people who ate the same bad diet but without the berries.
At Red Hill Berries farm near Caboolture, north of Brisbane, the picking of 10ha of plump pink raspberries grown for the Driscoll group is in full swing, under the watchful eye of farm manager Shane Hodgkiss. Owner Richard McGruddy said he was not surprised to hear of the latest health benefits linked to berries. ""The flavour and the taste that is coming through in these new varieties that we now grow is really being picked up by consumers, who know they are really healthy to eat,"" he said.

Paleo Pete takes on science
PALEO poster boy Pete Evans has launched a scathing tirade against science after a study found the caveman-style diet carried risks for overweight and diabetic people.
Despite the University of Melbourne research appearing in one of the world's most respected scientific journals, the celebrity chef used Facebook to question the qualifications and motives of the professors involved in the study.
The My Kitchen Rules judge also publicly questioned whether esteemed scientist Associate Professor Sof Andrikopoulos's work was being bankrolled by multinational companies, while labelling the researcher a ""so-called professional"" who was ""clutching at straws"".
""You do have to ask the question... who is funding this study? Does this university or the professor have any ties with any pharmaceutical or multinational funding?"" Evans posted.
""Perhaps this professor might like to work with real scientists who are passionate about getting the TRUTH out there and doing studies on... wait for it... HUMANS."" As disclosed in the research, published in Nature, Dr Andrikopoulos's study, undertaken at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne, was funded by the Federal Government's National Health and Medical Research Council.
""This study was not funded by pharmaceutical companies or food companies, and all of the funding is clearly stated in the Nature paper,"" a University of Melbourne statement said.
Evans yesterday clarified his Facebook post, saying he rejected the parameters of the study because it placed too much emphasis on fat and did not represent a paleo lifestyle.
Dr Andrikopoulos's research found a paleo-style diet resulted in a 15 per cent weight gain and rising insulin levels in overweight mice. While the results prompted the researchers to warn that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet could carry risks for overweight people, Dr Andrikopoulos did not draw any conclusions for healthier, more active people.

Cheaper medicine warning
HUNDREDS of thousands of patients could be at risk of anaphylaxis, blood clots and medicine failure now chemists can switch their biologic medicines, doctors warn.
These very expensive medicines are used to treat arthritis, diabetes, cancer, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. In the coming months cheaper versions of these medicines - called biosimilars - will come on to the Australian market.
While these cheaper medicines are safe, there are concerns that switching between different brands of them might pose some risks to patients. Doctors warn this should only be done only under medical supervision.
The Government stands to save $880 million if it can shift patients on to the cheaper drugs that are similar but not exactly the same, allowing other breakthrough medicines to be funded.
It wants to speed up that shift and this week changed legislation to allow a chemist to switch the medicine when a patient presents a script in the same way they can substitute cheaper generic drugs.
Before a chemist can make this switch, the expert Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee must decide it is safe to switch the biosimilar medicines. However, in making that decision the PBAC says it will have a default position of allowing substitution and consider absence of data about safety or efficacy problems with the drugs as relevant.
Diabetes Australia told a Senate committee: ""This shift in the 'burden of proof' is concerning. Medicines should not be subject to considerations that rely on the 'absence of data' to prove their safety or efficacy. This has the potential to impact over 365,000 Australians currently using insulin to manage their diabetes."" Doctors can prevent any substitution by ticking a do-not-substitute box on the script and patients can tell the chemist they don't want to switch brands.
The substitution policy has attracted outrage and concern from medical specialists, consumer groups, and even the drug companies that stand to profit from selling cheaper biosimilar medicines. Even the Pharmacy Guild, representing chemists, says there must be a robust process around possible adverse ""safety outcomes or risks for patients"". But Health Minister Sussan Ley said the Government was committed to accepting the expert advice of the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) without ""fear or favour"".

WARNING ON PALEO
LIVING on a paleo diet could put dieters' health and waistlines at risk, according to research.
Following the caveman-style diet for only eight weeks can lead to rapid weight gain, health complications and an acceleration of pre-diabetes symptoms for those already overweight, a University of Melbourne study found.
The results are so alarming lead researcher Professor Sof Andrikopoulos has issued a warning over the fad diet popularised by celebrities, including paleo poster boy Pete Evans.
Results from animal tests intended to demonstrate the benefits of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet stunned scientists when they actually resulted in a 15 per cent weight gain and rising insulin levels.
""If you are an individual with obesity and pre-diabetes, this type of diet would make you gain even further weight and push you into the diabetic range,"" Prof Andrikopoulos said.
A paleo diet favours heavy serves of meat, vegetables, eggs, nuts and fish, but outlaws grains, dairy, legumes, processed food and refined sugar.
During the study, the University of Melbourne researchers placed one group of overweight mice on a paleo-style low-carb, high-fat diet, while another group of fat mice stayed on their normal food.
Results published in the journal Nutrition and Diabetes reveal that after eight weeks the weight of the paleo mice ballooned by 15 per cent and their fat mass doubled as their glucose intolerance worsened and their insulin levels rose.
With the mouse and human genome being very similar, the researchers believe the results would be mirrored in overweight people. ""To put that in perspective, for a 100kg person, that's the equivalent of 15kg in two months. That's extreme weight gain,"" Prof Andrikopoulos said.
""You put an individual who is already not moving a lot on a low-carb, high-fat diet and what happens is that they don't have the ability to burn the extra fat they are eating, so they gain weight, and that is really bad."" While the paleo-style diet may have benefits for active and already healthy people, such as its celebrity proponents, Prof Andrikopoulos urged would-be dieters to seek professional advice better suited to their needs.
Brisbane nutritionist Lynda Mannering said the paleo diet was based around real food. ""How can eating real food be unhealthy,"" she said. ""It's hard for people because their lifestyles are so busy... but it's just about clean eating.""

SA diabetes study launched
SOME children may be destined for type 2 diabetes as adults due to behaviour by their mother and possibly father changing their genetic make-up before they are even born, experts suspect.
While poor diet and lack of exercise are typically blamed, growing evidence suggests the diabetes epidemic in the Aboriginal community has far more complex causes.
The South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute's Wardliparingga Aboriginal Research Unit will today, World Diabetes Day, launch the largest study into diabetes of its kind ever undertaken.
Researchers hope to recruit 4000 Aboriginal people across South Australia to take part - 2000 with diabetes and 2000 without - to better understand its causes and complications.
Among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Type 2 diabetes is seen at rates three to four times higher than in other Australians.
SAHMRI's Aboriginal Health Theme Leader, Professor Alex Brown, said the study hoped to recruit one in six Aboriginal people over the age of 15 in SA.

Mixed news for listed education provider
Newly listed education provider Australian Careers Network has raised its earnings guidance for the financial year after reporting a 78 per cent increase in the number of enrolments.
But the company, which listed in December, said the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development had suspended some payments to the company's Consider This Training division and terminated a contract for the provision of diabetes education.
ACN, in a statement released to the stock exchange on Friday, said the DEECD's Higher Education Skills Group was conducting an inquiry into the provision of Certificate II diabetes courses, and was withholding payments for 133 students enrolled with Consider This Training last year.
The DEECD had also suspended payments related to the diabetes courses with the ACN-owned Australian Management Academy.
""The company is simultaneously conducting its own investigation, contacting students and gathering evidence, which the board is confident will positively affect the final (DEECD) decision,"" the statement read.
""The board also understands that at least four other (registered training providers) have also had funding suspended for the diabetes course and notes that seven of the eight RTOs with the course on scope have taken reference to the course off their website."" ACN, led by managing director Ivan Brown, said it believed the issue would not have a material impact on its finances, and expects earnings of $24 million to $27m for the 12 months to the end of June, compared to a prospectus forecast of $22.48m.

Mums in probiotic trial for diabetes
MOTHERS-TO-BE will be given probiotics in an effort to address the rising incidence of gestational diabetes, in a world-first study being done in Brisbane hospitals.
Gestational diabetes is a common pregnancy complication, particularly for overweight and obese women.
The study, being run at Mater Mothers' Hospital and Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, will build on international research suggesting pregnant women who take probiotics - live beneficial microorganisms - are less likely to suffer the condition.
""Gestational diabetes rates are definitely increasing and there are two obvious factors - increasing obesity and women having their babies later,"" said Mater Clinical School head Professor David McIntyre.
""There are risks for mum and baby - babies are bigger and fatter, there are more difficult deliveries and a higher risk of caesarean section and high blood pressure.
""There is quite a lot of data emerging about probiotics; this will be the first to look at the impact on overweight and obese women."" Professor McIntyre said 10 to 13 per cent of Mater Mothers' patients - about 1000 women each year - were treated for gestational diabetes. Treatment for the condition currently includes a modified diet and increased physical activity, or in some cases insulin injections.
More than 500 pregnant women with a BMI of more than 25kg/m2 are needed for the two-year study, with 180 women recruited to date.
Half of the women in the trial will take a daily probiotic capsule, while the other half will receive a placebo.

Big risks as young adults stack it on
Young adults aged between 25 and 34 are gaining weight at a faster rate than any other age group, putting them at higher risk of developing serious health problems, a 12-year study has found.
The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study tracked more than 11,000 adults to find how many developed diabetes, obesity, kidney and heart disease.
The report, released today by the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, prompted warnings from health professionals that Australians were failing to make the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent serious health risks linked to obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.
The study revealed that people aged 25 to 34 gained more weight and waist circumference during the 12 years compared with all other age groups.
Baker IDI associate director Jonathan Shaw said the trend was ""very concerning"" because it indicated that Australia still did not recognise the serious health risks linked to obesity.
""The health and wellbeing of a whole generation of young Australians is being compromised by a lifestyle rich in energy-dense foods and low on physical activity,"" he said.
Professor Shaw said the community needed to take tough decisions to discourage behaviours that led to poor health and put increased pressure on the health budget and system.
Incentives were also needed to help people make healthier lifestyle choices.
""At this stage, I think everything should be on the table - taxation levers, town planning, even the layout of office spaces needs to be reconsidered - to tackle the growing personal and community impact of chronic disease,"" he said.
The study revealed the incidence of diabetes in Australia remained high, with about 269 people over the age of 25 diagnosed each day.
Having diabetes doubled the chances of being admitted to hospital and of requiring multiple visits to a GP.
Even though obesity is one of the biggest risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes, more than one-third of people who took part in the study did not do enough exercise.
Curtin University health policy professor Mike Daube said the report showed Australia's obesity problem was getting worse. ""The implications for future healthcare costs are terrifying,"" he said.

Artificial pancreas trial starts
THE first of 17 Tasmanian diabetic sufferers will begin a potentially game-changing trial at the Royal Hobart Hospital next week.
The Royal is one of seven hospitals in the Australia-first trial run by University of Melbourne and St Vincent's Hospital, which aims to see if blood glucose levels can be stabilised, improving quality of life.
Type 1 diabetes patients get an artificial pancreas that automatically senses when they need insulin and pumps it into their body.
The trial will test the device in 120 adults, including 17 Tasmanians, over six months.
RHH endocrinologist Roland McCallum said the trial would begin on Friday. ""This technology could reduce the risk of having a hypo [low blood sugar] and that's a problem diabetic patients live with all the time, particularly through the night,"" Dr McCallum said. Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune condition in which the body destroys insulin-producing cells. Just over 5 per cent of the Tasmanian population has diabetes, but 86.1 per cent have type 2.

BLOOD KITS TO AID KIDS
FEDERAL ELECTION 2016 THOUSANDS of kids with type 1 diabetes will be given pocket-size continuous glucose monitoring devices that will save lives and spare families $4000 a year.
Saving kids from being woken in the middle of the night for blood tests to check their glucose levels, the new kits can also be combined with insulin pumps to provide more accurate doses.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will today announce that if re-elected, his Government will devote $54 million to ensure thousands of families can secure the gadgets for the first time.
In his first major health policy announcement of the campaign, Mr Turnbull will confirm that all children and young adults under the age of 21 will be eligible for the scheme.
""Our commitment is estimated to benefit as many as 4000 children and young adults, and it could save the average family up to $4000 per year off the cost of managing their child's type 1 diabetes,"" Mr Turnbull said.
""It will help reduce possible visits to emergency departments and missed school days by allowing families and children to better self-manage their diabetes. Most importantly, it will help reduce stress and anxiety for children and their parents, and even save lives."" Mr Turnbull has also averted an election war with pathologists over their threat to leave patients out of pocket for blood, urine and pap smear tests, in a separate deal that will cap rents at collection centres.
The fight had sparked warnings that tests could soon cost patients $30, and it triggered a major campaign in marginal seats across Australia.
Today's announcement on a new deal to help kids with diabetes was hailed by Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation chief Mike Wilson as a huge win for families who had campaigned for years for the continuous glucose monitors to be subsidised.
The kits monitor blood-sugar levels 24 hours a day through a small device that is inserted under the skin and left in place for up to six days.
The Government estimates it will save families up to $50,000, based on the average diagnosis, or if a child has the device from birth through to 21, up to $90,000. Parents currently pay up to $4000 a year for the kits, which spare kids from up to 15 finger-prick blood tests a day.

WA team hopes to predict diabetes
WA researchers are trying to create a test that would allow them to predict the chances of some people getting type 1 diabetes or developing certain complications.
The test, which looks for genetic patterns, would be used in people with type 1 diabetes to predict their lifetime risk of developing complications such as diabetic coma or kidney failure.
It could also be used in brothers or sisters of a child with type 1 diabetes to find out whether they are likely to be affected.
The Diabetes Research Foundation of WA has given a $75,000 grant to Grant Morahan, director of the Centre for Diabetes Research at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, to carry out the research with Dr Joey Kaye from Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital's diabetes clinic.
""A test that can be applied at the time of diagnosis and predict someone's lifetime risk of developing diabetic complications will be a great help to affected children, their families and the clinicians caring for them, as well as saving vital health dollars,"" Professor Morahan said.
""Likewise, a test that gives us the ability to be able to say that brothers or sisters of a child with type 1 diabetes will likely remain unaffected will also provide relief to anxious families.""
Professor Morahan said the project would build on his team's recent breakthroughs in identifying particular genetic signatures that define six different genetic subtypes of type 1 diabetes. They hope to recruit 400 people for the research program. See diabetesresearchfoundation.asn.au.

Genetic bid to beat diabetes
Perth researchers will use a unique ""gene mine"" based on mice to work out the best diet to protect from type 2 diabetes.
It could lead to advice to stick to a low-carbohydrate diet or avoid a high-protein diet, depending on people's different genetic make-up.
Lead researcher Grant Morahan, who will reveal details of the project at a Diabetes Research WA seminar next month, said the study would help people choose their ideal diet to reduce the chances of developing type 2 diabetes.
More than 1.7 million Australians have diabetes and 85 per cent are type 2.
Professor Morahan said there was a maze of diet information and though advocates often suggested their diet was good for everyone, this was very unlikely.
""We will find what genes interact with different diets to cause type 2 diabetes, which will eventually allow us to work out what is the best diet for which people,"" he said
""It's possible, for example, we may find people with a particular combination of genes should avoid a high-protein diet and opt for a Mediterranean diet.
""Or people with a different set of genes may benefit from a low-carbohydrate diet.""
The project will also involve researchers from China and the US, and will draw on the Gene Mine developed by WA's Centre for Diabetes Research.
The resource contains the entire mouse genome, or genetic blueprint, allowing researchers to fast-track complex genetic studies in a few years.
""A human study into this would take millions of dollars and thousands of participants and would need to be done over 20 to 30 years,"" Professor Morahan said. ""The sort of diet information that could come from this would be very powerful.""

LIFE QUENCHER
SUGARY drinks can cause type 2 diabetes irrespective of whether the drinkers gained weight, according to a major Australian-led study.
Previously it had been assumed that sugar consumption led to weight gain that then led to type 2 diabetes.
But an Australian National University-led study of 40,000 adults showed the more sugary drinks consumed, the higher the risk.
But men and women react differently to sugary drinks such as soft drinks, flavoured milk and sweetened juices.
Women are far more likely to develop type 2 diabetes from regular consumption. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the body's processing of sugar.
Around 1.7 million Australians have diabetes, 85-90 per cent of which is type 2. And it is estimated that 500,000 Australians have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.
The 2005-13 study of 40,000 Thai adults showed that sugar-sweetened beverages were driving the epidemic increase in diabetes.
Women who drank one or more sugary beverages a day had a 90 per cent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes simply due to this, irrespective of their body mass index.
Those who drank from one to six sugar-sweetened beverages a week were 50 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
Over the eight-year period men who consumed one or more such beverages a day saw a 30 per cent rise in risk.
The latest study also showed over 4000 cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented annually in the Thai population if people avoided sugary drinks daily.
Lead author of the study, Keren Papier, said that figure would easily translate to the Australian population.
""A reduction in sugary drink consumption is likely reduce rates of diabetes in Australia,"" Ms Papier said.
She said warnings for women in particular to drink fewer sugary beverages could be necessary.
The new study comes just days after a separate study found that Australian soft drinks had 22 per cent higher levels of glucose than soft drinks overseas.
Several countries including Mexico, the United States, France and Chile, have already begun acting over sugary drinks, by imposing or promising a sugar tax.
Implementing the tax in the US and Mexico, in particular, has led to a 17 per cent and 21 per cent decrease in purchases of taxed beverages among low-income households.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt's spokesman said the government was working on programs to encourage healthy living, but a sugar tax was not being considered.
The GST encouraged healthful food choices: it applied to chips, lollies, sugary drinks, confectionery, snacks, ice-cream and biscuits, but not to fruit and vegetables.
""We don't believe increasing the family grocery bill at the supermarket is the answer to this challenge,"" he said.
AMA president Michael Gannon said the study's findings were ""very concerning"". Dr Gannon said a tax on sugar was needed, but as with tobacco the battle would be fought long and hard.
""We need to give a price signal to individuals that these are not normal drinks and should be used selectively, or not consumed by anyone,"" he said.
Angela Magarry, CEO of the Council of Presidents of Medical Colleges, said the study supported a sugar tax.
""If the evidence is there we would also support measures that would lead to better labelling and better warnings on the drinks themselves.""

Insulin pumps give 'life back'
Using insulin pumps to treat type 1 diabetes in children is more effective at controlling blood sugar levels and causes fewer complications than insulin injections, a WA study has found.
The research, published in the journal Diabetologia, followed 345 patients who had pumps attached to their bodies, matching them with patients of a similar age who used injections.
The study found pump therapy reduced episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (dangerously low blood glucose) from 14.3 to 7.2 events for every 100 patients each year.
Princess Margaret Hospital for Children researcher Elizabeth Davis said this was the first long-term study to show increased glycaemic control and reduced hospital admissions.
With an insulin pump costing between $8000 and $10,000, Dr Davis said she hoped they would eventually be available to all children with diabetes, not just those with private health cover or support from charities such as the PMH Foundation.
Woodvale mother-of-three Ruth Pascoe said the pump had been ""amazing"" because it freed the family from a rigid structure of injections and eating times.
Her daughter Faith, 6, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes just before her second birthday and started using a pump about three and a half years ago. Ethan, 5, was diagnosed when he was four and went on a pump immediately.

Type 2 Diabetes
Although it's a growing concern in Australia, type 2 diabetes can be managed with lifestyle changes, health checks and medication.
Almost 1 million people in Australia have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - and this number is growing. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes; about 90 per cent of people with diabetes have it. It usually affects adults, but an increasing number of children are developing it.
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are different. In type 1 diabetes, the body produces little or no insulin, resulting in high levels of blood glucose.
In type 2, the body makes insulin but doesn't control the amount of glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood properly.
High blood glucose can cause a range of symptoms and complications over time.
Type 2 diabetes can be managed with lifestyle changes, regular health checks and a range of medicines.
Who is at risk?
Certain genetic and lifestyle factors increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.
The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to develop it.
Risk factors include:
Family history of diabetes.
Being overweight.
High blood pressure.
Cardiovascular disease.
Age (55 or older).
Previous gestational diabetes - gestational diabetes is similar to the type 2 form, but occurs only in pregnancy and usually improves after childbirth. One in 20 pregnant women will be affected.
Symptoms
Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include urinating frequently, continual thirst and weight gain. Many people won't notice their symptoms until their type 2 diabetes has become advanced.
Diagnosis
Diabetes is usually diagnosed after a blood glucose test during a medical check-up.
When diagnosing your diabetes, a doctor will consider your family history, age, weight, symptoms, laboratory tests, other health conditions and medicines.
Complications
Diabetes affects your health in different ways. Complications caused by high blood glucose include loss of vision, kidney damage, heart attack, stroke, and nerve and foot problems.
Many diabetes complications are related to blood vessel damage caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking.
Conventional treatments
For some people, lifestyle changes may be enough to manage type 2 diabetes and prevent complications.
Others may need tablets and/or injections as well.
Lifestyle changes
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle helps reduce blood glucose and prevent complications. It's important to:
Follow a healthy, low-fat diet.
Be physically active (at least 30 minutes, five days a week).
Maintain a healthy weight.
Limit alcohol intake.
Quit smoking.
Most people will eventually need medication in addition to lifestyle changes to manage their blood glucose levels.
Medicines
There are many medicines for type 2 diabetes; metformin, sulfonylureas and insulin are commonly prescribed and have been shown to reduce the risk of complications. Other medicines include ""gliptins"", ""glitazones"", exenatide and acarbose.
The type and dose of diabetes medicines will differ for everyone according to their symptoms and individual needs. They may change as your diabetes progresses, during pregnancy and illness, depending on symptoms, age, health and other medicines.
It's important to tell health professionals about all the medicines you are taking, including prescription, over-the-counter and complementary medicines (such as natural and herbal remedies), because some medicines may affect blood glucose control or interact with your diabetes medicines.
Ongoing management
Managing type 2 diabetes isn't just about glucose. Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol is just as important for reducing your risk of complications. Lowering blood pressure and cholesterol can prevent three times as many heart attacks and strokes as lowering blood glucose alone.
Healthy eating and physical activity are vital if you have diabetes, whether or not you are taking medicines. This can help control blood pressure, cholesterol and body weight, and reduce your risk of complications in the long term.
People with diabetes also need to have regular blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol and other health checks to make sure that any complications are identified early, monitored and treated.
When to contact a medical professional
See your doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of diabetes.
Make an appointment with your doctor to plan your diabetes care and organise the health checks you need each year (known as your diabetes annual cycle of care).
Your doctor can also refer you to a range of healthcare specialists including a dietician, diabetes educator, exercise physiologist or podiatrist.

At a glance
About one in 25 Australians has type 2 diabetes. Managing blood pressure and cholesterol is just as important as managing blood glucose.

Diabetes cure hope
Ending Australia's diabetes epidemic could be one step closer, with a new technique curing the condition in mice.
US scientists announced the breakthrough, which uses a novel approach that may eliminate type 1 diabetes and see painful insulin injections become a thing of the past.
University of Texas Health Science Centre doctors used a virus as a carrier to introduce insulin-producing genes into the pancreas of rodents.
Professor Ralph DeFronzo said researchers altered cells so they secreted insulin, but only in response to glucose - mimicking the behaviour of the body's beta cells.
This study bypasses the autoimmune system by altering other pancreatic cells so they can coexist with immune defences - unlike beta cells, which are rejected in type 1 patients.
Type 1 diabetes is now treated by monitoring glucose levels and injecting artificial insulin up to four times a day. While technology has made management of the condition easier, a cure has been elusive.

Diabetes surge in kids worries doctors
Doctors are worried by a record number of WA children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes this year, with about 30 per cent more cases than average.
Princess Margaret Hospital endocrinologist Liz Davis, who is co-director of the Children's Diabetes Centre based at the Telethon Kids Institute, said more than 150 children had been diagnosed with diabetes this year. The number of cases had been steadily rising but this year's surge was unexplained.
""In WA we tend to have a five-year cycle, with a neat pattern of some years with fewer cases and some with more, but this peak is way out of proportion,"" Professor Davis said.
""For me one of the big concerns about this increased rate is that 25 to 30 per cent of children in WA who present with diabetes are so unwell that they end up in intensive care.""
Professor Davis said the extra cases put added pressure on the diabetes clinic, which managed all WA children with the condition.
It was a significant life event when a child was diagnosed, as they needed to be seen immediately and their family needed support. Professor Davis said type 1 was caused by genetic and environmental factors, but because gene patterns did not change quickly, the increase was probably more related to factors such as viral triggers that set off the autoimmune process.
The clinic was also seeing a rise in type 2 diabetes cases, which tended to be caused by lifestyle factors.
Professor Davis said the first signs of diabetes in children were weight loss, and the need to drink a lot and go to the toilet often, which could be difficult to gauge over summer.
Ten-year-old Ella Fairman was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes two months ago while in NSW with her family for a wedding.
Her mother Amy said they were at the house of a friend who had type 1 diabetes, and she mentioned that Ella was always thirsty, not sleeping well and had blurred vision.
They checked Ella's blood sugars levels, which were dangerously high, and she had to stay in hospital until she was stable enough to fly home to Perth.
""It's been a big learning curve for us, and they only let us fly home when they were confident we knew what we were doing,"" Mrs Fairman said. ""But we're happy with how Ella has handled it so far.""

Diabetes cure on the cards
ADELAIDE researchers are developing an implantable ""SIM card"" they believe will eventually lead to a universal effective cure for type 1 diabetes.
The card would be implanted in diabetic children and would contain insulin-producing cell islets - harvested from donor pancreases - ending the need for daily injections and the risk of dangerous hypoglycaemic episodes.
Transplanted islets already are used successfully, but side effects from anti-rejection drugs means only people who suffer extreme cases of ""hypo"" episodes qualify for the present system, in which the islets are diffused into the recipient's liver, sometimes taking multiple procedures.
Only about 30 such procedures have been carried out in Australia, including seven in South Australia. These include people who no longer need daily insulin injections after, in some cases, 40 years of relying on needles. About 140,000 Australians have type 1 diabetes.
A $3.3 million Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation grant of Federal Government money this month will enable researchers to continue work towards training ""super islets"" to be capable of fending off a recipient's natural immune reaction to a foreign body.
This would end the need for immunosuppression drugs, and pave the way for islet transplants to be available to virtually anyone with type 1 diabetes.
The grant will support research at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and University of Adelaide in conjunction with sites in Sydney and Melbourne.
RAH head of renal transplantation Professor Toby Coates, one of the study investigators, said the aim was to allow people to have the islet transplants without the risk of them also needing anti-rejection drugs.
""We are looking at a protocol of transplanting the islets without using drugs, partly based on modifying the islets themselves,"" he said.
""There is a protein called A20, which is an anti-inflammatory molecule which if over expressed in islets can make them resistant to rejection so you don't need immunosuppression drugs.
""Our role is to put patients into trials for the next three years. ""If it succeeds you could absolutely expand the number of people this could be applied to. At the moment we have to weigh up the side effects of drugs because most people can keep their condition under control using the conventional approach."" Prof Coates said the drug-free approach builds on more than a decade of work. ""If all goes well, down the track we could be looking at potentially using this approach as an effective cure for children diagnosed with the type 1 diabetes.
""We are looking at an implant device a little like a SIM card with special islets."" Last month The Advertiser reported on SA's first two women effectively cured of type 1 diabetes using transplanted islets at the RAH - Margaret Hannigan marking five years since her transplant and Tracy Drynan marking four years, both no longer needing daily insulin injections after 40 years in each case.
According to Diabetes Australia: AROUND 1.7 million Australians have diabetes.
TYPE 1 diabetes accounts for 10 per cent of all diabetes and is increasing TYPE 2 diabetes accounts for 85 per cent of all diabetes and is increasing
TOTAL annual cost of diabetes in Australia is estimated at $14.6 billion.

Making tracks for diabetes research
Tackling the 1000km Bibbulmun Track is a challenge in itself, but a Bunbury man is determined to make it tougher by attempting to break a speed record and raise money to find a cure for diabetes.
What started as a way of boosting his fitness has turned into a self-sufficient mission for Darren King, 44, who has been training for nearly a year to walk the entire trail solo and for the first time, starting next week.
The builder's goal is to raise $1million - $1 for every metre - and beat the record held since 2011 by ultra-marathon runner Bernadette Benson, who completed the track that stretches from Kalamunda to Albany in 15 days, nine hours and 48 minutes.
Carrying a 10kg backpack plus food and water, Mr King will aim to walk from 4am to 8pm every day to finish in less than 14 days.
To ensure his self-sufficiency, he will place extra food and water packages along the track.
""My friends say I never do things by halves, so rather than just walk it I decided I wanted to do it the fastest,"" he said.
Mr King said the mental challenge, snakes, heat and blisters would make the hike tough, but he was determined to achieve his goal to help those with Type 1 diabetes, including his wife, Jenn.
The experienced camper said a lifetime in the outdoors had made him ""comfortable being out in the middle of nowhere"".

""I decided I needed to address that as quickly as possible as the future was looking pretty bleak."" Working for Diabetes Australia (Vic) he was only too aware about the potential complications of diabetes. ""Because of where I work, I would hear stories about people that had had heart attacks and strokes. I met one person who was an amputee and met others who were going to be amputees - and that was enough for me to realise my health was a concern."" Weighing 128kg, Colin decided to re-educate himself about food and exercise and lose weight. Since then he has dropped 33kg and plans to lose another 10-15kg which, he hopes, will put him in a low-risk category.
He started exercising at the gym, walking at every opportunity and taking every chance - even 20 minutes at lunch - to be active. And he reduced the portion sizes of his food as well as replacing snacks with healthier options.

Assault on diabetes 
RESEARCHERS are stepping up their fight against one of the most common chronic childhood conditions.
Australia's leading type 1 diabetes researchers are being brought together under a $9.5 million Melbourne-led research project to prevent and develop new treatments for the condition.
To mark today's World Diabetes Day, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt will announce the massive research project hoped to one day help find ways to prevent it occurring in the first place.
Led by St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research, the federally funded program will also see teams from Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Research as well as Sydney's Westmead Institute of Research and Westmead Clinical School collaborating.
St Vincent's Institute's Professor Thomas Kay said the scale of the project would potentially be life changing for many Australians who dealt with the emotional, physical and financial effects of type 1 diabetes every day.
""It is our intention to make discoveries that positively impact on those living with the disease, and hopefully, prevent others from developing it in the future,"" Prof Kay said.
""This grant represents the support and endorsement of a collaborative approach by our government, among Australia's four top type 1 diabetes research teams, and we are delighted to be working together.
""Collectively, we have spent many years of our professional lives investigating type 1 diabetes, so we are both keen, and committed, to do our best to make discoveries that will prevent or minimise its impacts."" Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic childhood conditions, affecting about 140,000 Australians and accounting for one in 10 cases of all diabetes cases.
Unlike type 2 diabetes - which is caused by having too much glucose and is linked to lifestyle factors - the cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown.
There is no cure for type 1 diabetes, and those with the condition must manage by having daily insulin injections or receiving an insulin pump and constantly monitoring their blood sugar levels.
Those with type 1 diabetes suffer falling blood sugar levels if they skip a meal, exercise too heavily or take in too much insulin, which can lead to dizziness, sweating, hunger, headache and mood changes until they gain a sugar boost.
While the condition usually begins affecting patients early in life, research suggest half its sufferers are diagnosed after they turn 30.

FDA no-go for diabetes drug rocks pSivida shares
Shares in pSivida were hammered down to a five-month low yesterday as Australian investors digested Friday's rejection by the Food and Drug Administration.
With its US stock giving up 24.5 per cent after the FDA announcement, pSivida's Australian shares followed suit by surrendering 26 per cent, or $1.04, to $2.80 in heavy trading.
The FDA shattered the company's hopes of gaining access to the lucrative US market for its flagship product by rejecting approval for its Iluvien drug delivery implant.
The FDA, which had twice rejected Iluvien on concerns about its side effects, said the product would need another clinical trial and more follow-up data.
However, analysts say that by scheduling a meeting of its advisory committee for January 27, the agency has provided some prospect of pSivida and its licensee, US group Alimera Sciences, recovering the position.
Iluvien, a back-of-the-eye treatment for diabetic eye disease, is already commercially available in six countries in Europe. The FDA cited ""clinical and statistical deficiencies"" in its rejection.
Both pSivida and Alimera said they were ""extremely disappointed"" by the ruling but would continue to work with the FDA on ""a path forward in the US"".
However, they have also hinted they could instead increase their focus on Europe.
Iluvien, a tiny polymer tube, is injected into the back of the eye via a 25-gauge needle, slowly releasing a drug over three years, which eliminates the need for more frequent injections.

Diabetes could cost economy $2.9 billion
Diabetes will cost the Australian economy $2.9 billion in lost income by 2030, according to new estimates.
Australian researchers say an increase in the number of people aged 45 to 64 with diabetes will cost the economy heavily, not just in healthcare expenses but in indirect costs such as loss of income and tax revenue coupled with higher welfare payments.
Their study, the first to look at the impact of older workers leaving the labour market because of diabetes, said it would cost Australia's gross domestic product $2.9 billion by 2030, as the number of people unable to work increased to more than 21,000.
This would cause a 73 per cent increase in loss of income due to diabetes between now and 2030, as well as a 63 per cent increase in lost taxation revenue and a 13 per cent increase in welfare payments.
The research, led by the University of Sydney, warned that both individuals and governments would incur significant costs from diabetes on top of the direct healthcare costs, which were estimated to be $1.5 billion in 2009.
Diabetes Research WA executive director Sherl Westlund said the findings were worrying.
""The massive personal loss highlighted by this study is truly heartbreaking and the economic cost astounding,"" she said.
""Researchers around the world are urgently searching for new answers but the fight requires more funds to deliver solutions as quickly as possible.
""We hope the study findings may also act as wake up call to those at increased risk of type 2 diabetes to immediately seek support and do all they can to avoid a lifetime of living with this disease, because prevention, where possible, is paramount.""

Sharp workouts beat moderation
DIABETES researchers have produced new evidence that quick workouts are more beneficial than sustained exercise.
Scientists from the University of Otago, in Dunedin, have found that short, intense bursts of activity before meals help control diabetics' blood-sugar levels.
But half an hour of moderate exercise, the regime typically recommended in international health guidelines, has no effect.
The findings, published today in the journal Diabetologia, add to a growing body of evidence in support of what the team calls ""exercise snacking"".
Lead author Monique Francois said short episodes of intense exercise before breakfast and dinner gave people more health benefits in half the time.
""We wanted to compare it to that traditional guideline message, the 30 minutes a day,"" she said. ""Going for a 30-minute walk doesn't cut it. You need to get out there and do intense exercise."" While previous research has shown that vigorous exercise helps reduce blood-glucose levels in diabetics, the Otago study was the first to directly compare high energy and moderate bouts, and to test the benefits of exercise before meals.
Adults with insulin resistance, a precursor to type-2 diabetes, alternated a half-hour walk with six one-minute intervals of heart-pumping ""incline walking"", half an hour before meals.
Daily walks had no measurable impact on glucose levels, but the intense sessions reduced the duration of blood-sugar spikes by about 40 per cent for two days. Ms Francois said she would not advocate cutting exercise too drastically. ""(But) both the timing and intensity of exercise should be considered,"" she said.

Outcomes gain from alliances
Better use of allied health professionals in chronic care management could deliver improved outcomes and significant savings, says a leading health expert.
Karen Grimmer, director of the International Centre for Allied Health Evidence at the University of South Australia, said yesterday her team of researchers had examined healthcare for newly diagnosed diabetic foot conditions.
Professor Grimmer said if GPs were aware of the condition and referred patients to podiatrists who used best practice, the resulting efficacy and efficiency gains would benefit the patient and the system.
""We could save $7 million in South Australia alone in one year,"" Professor Grimmer told the event.
""That is an extraordinary amount of money to me. But that money is being misspent because people are getting ulcers, they're getting infections, they're getting osteomyelitis and they're ending up with amputations. And our costing didn't even take into account the cost post-amputation of the prosthetic limb, the rehab, the ongoing management that has to happen. Our frustration in allied health is that the money is there but it is being spent badly."" An atlas of healthcare variation prepared by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care found higher rates of amputations in regional and remote areas. Indigenous people are about three times more likely to have diabetes, 10 times more likely to be admitted for diabetic foot complications and 30 times more likely to suffer diabetes-related lower limb amputation than non-indigenous people. Health Minister Sussan Ley, who has foreshadowed workforce reforms next year, has vowed to make better use of allied health professionals through Health Care Homes and mental health initiatives. ""This work will continue to be complemented by integrated reforms to mental health, medicines, hospital funding, rural health, aged care, dental, private health insurance, vaccinations, sports participation and preventive health,"" Ms Ley said this week.

Focus on diabetics
DIABETICS should be screened as part of a national program to prevent thousands of Australians going blind.
More than 10,000 Australians have lost their vision in the past decade as a result of the disease, but another 300,000 have diabetic retinopathy, which makes it hard to read or watch TV. Eye experts say many of these cases could be avoided if diabetics underwent regular screening.
Professor Peter Scanlon, who set up a screening program in the UK in 2003 and is in Australia to share his knowledge, said it was the most common cause of blindness in the working age population.
Diabetic retinopathy damages blood vessels inside the retina, which can cause vision loss and blindness.
Prof Scanlon said Australia needed to do something to catch the disease at an earlier stage.
""There are lots of late presentations to the doctors in Australia,"" he said. ""If you wait until people have lost vision, it's usually quite an advanced stage and more difficult to treat and people are more likely to have a permanent loss of vision.
""I think you can prevent up to 90 per cent of cases through early detection and intervention."" This may include better control of the individual's blood sugar levels, medication or laser surgery.
Centre for Eye Research Australia (CERA) principal investigator and ophthalmologist Dr Peter van Wijngaarden said diabetics can get biannual eye checks through Medicare, but only half of them do.
A screening program would invite diabetics to have their eyes photographed regularly to monitor their eye health. Not only would eye screening and early detection assist diabetics, it has been shown to be more cost effective.
CERA, Diabetes Australia and Baker IDI are leading the charge for a national screening program.
It is estimated 60 per cent of people with type 2 diabetes will develop eye disease within 20 years of their diagnosis.

Prof Kemp and colleague Dr Sandra Galic genetically engineered mice so that two enzymes in the liver that control fat synthesis could not be switched off by an enzyme called AMPK.
Co-authors from Canada's McMaster University put the mice on a high-fat diet so they became obese.
""What was really remarkable was when you gave them the drug metformin, which would improve their blood glucose levels, it no longer worked in the mice,"" Prof Kemp said. He said metformin is able to activate the enzyme AMPK, which mimicked some of the effects of exercise.

Diabetes issue the medical 'tsunami of the modern age'
The incidence of diabetes is growing at 7 to 10 per cent a year and has resulted in an increase in limb amputations of 25 per cent in two years, says Diabetes NSW.
""We talk about this issue as the [medical] tsunami of the modern age,"" says Sturt Eastwood, chief executive of the organisation.
Type 2 diabetes - which can be delayed or prevented in 58 per cent of cases - represents 85 to 90 per cent of all diabetes cases. It usually develops in adults over the age of 45 but is increasingly occurring in younger age groups.
It is a chronic condition that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin and/or the insulin does not work effectively to meet the body's needs. It is managed by lifestyle changes such as following a healthy eating plan and doing regular physical activity.
Meanwhile, type 1 diabetes - previously known as insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes - occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to produce the insulin the body needs because the cells that produce insulin have been destroyed by the body's immune system. It is usually managed by daily insulin injections.
Mr Eastwood said the extent of the problem could be witnessed at the foot clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. ""It is a high need area and they have a queue backed up for months,"" he said.
Treating diabetes costs about $7 billion a year Australia-wide, he said - which can be doubled if you include productivity loss to the economy.
It takes 10 to 20 years for complications to emerge from poorly managed type 2 diabetes as it destroys blood vessels and nerve endings, Mr Eastwood said. ""The problem is absolutely going to become worse and worse. There is a stigma associated with it, so now people don't talk about it and are not seeking support... so we are seeing more and more of these complications.
""In a year, or a year and a half, diabetes type 2 will be the single largest burden on Australia's health system. By the time you turn 50, quite frankly, you should be getting screened annually for diabetes.
""Up until now we have not taken on scare tactics [like pictures on cigarette packets] and I think it is almost time to start shocking government and the population.
Orthopaedic surgeon Gary Fettke has said walking around the wards of the hospital where he operates is ""like going into a leper colony"".
Patients ""are depressed and frightened of this disease that is eating away at them"", he says.
""Twenty years ago in northern Tasmania I was treating diabetes complications with amputations of toes, heels, feet and below the knee once every five to six months,"" Dr Fettke, who is based in Launceston, says.
""Now I am amputating every week and this year, twice some weeks.""

'Slapping cure' boy dies during workshop
DETECTIVES are investigating whether a diabetic boy who died after being taken off insulin underwent ""slapping therapy"" on advice of a self-proclaimed Chinese healer.
The family of Aidan Fenton, 7, were attending an $1800 week-long workshop at the Tasly Healthpac Centre in Sydney when he died.
Police have spoken to a Chinese therapist, who advocates slapping therapy until patients are bruised to cure illnesses and rid the body of poisons.
Hongchi Xiao, who hosted seminars at the workshop, has since left Australia. Police and paramedics were called to a hotel in nearby Hurstville, in Sydney's south, where the Year 1 student had been staying with his parents, after he was found unconscious about 9pm on Monday.
Hotel staff said they rushed to the family's aid after hearing screams coming from their room. Aidan's heart stopped on the way to hospital.
Police are now investigating whether the ""healer"" advised Aidan's parents to take him off insulin and instead encouraged alternate therapies, including massages and slapping.
Detectives questioned Mr Xiao before he left the country this week and spent the day taking statements from witnesses yesterday.
Homicide police were notified of Aidan's death but the investigation has been left to police from St George Local Area Command.
Mr Xiao had been in Sydney after touring New Zealand, promoting his PaidaLajin therapy, which involves slapping the body until it bruises to ""unblock meridians"".
Neighbours of the Fenton family described Aidan as a ""beautiful, really good boy"" and said his parents had been too traumatised to speak about the incident. His death will be referred to the Coroner, who will decide whether there is evidence of medical malpractice.

Cloning technique could help diabetes treatment
For the first time scientists have used cells from a woman with type 1 diabetes to create cloned human embryos from which they extracted embryonic stem cells.
The American-Israeli team also coaxed the stem cells into insulin-producing beta cells, the kind lost in patients with type 1 diabetes.
""These stem cells could therefore be used to generate cells for therapeutic cell replacement,"" research leader Dieter Egli, from the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute, said.
Embryonic stem cells are capable of transforming into any tissue in the body, not just insulin-producing cells. Therein lies their medical potential - to regenerate tissue or organs for transplant.
The benefit of stem cells obtained from cloned human embryos is they are genetically matched to the person who donated the adult cell, meaning they could be used to personalise therapies for a range of crippling diseases, not just diabetes.
But somatic cell nuclear transfer - the technique used to create Dolly the sheep - is ethically controversial in humans because it involves the creation of embryos for research that are subsequently destroyed.
To obtain stem cells from the cloned human embryo, the nucleus of a skin cell from the woman with type 1 diabetes was transferred into a donated human egg, which had had its nucleus removed.
The cells grew into early-stage embryos, or blastocysts, that gave rise to human embryonic stem cells. The researchers published their findings in the journal Nature.
Stem cell research has received a lot of attention lately. Earlier this month Korean and American researchers announced they were the first to use this method to extract stem cells from embryos cloned with adult cells. Previously, only foetal cells had been used to produce cloned embryos. But the breakthrough was overshadowed by controversy surrounding a Japanese scientist accused of falsifying data that supported another kind of ground-breaking stem cell research. Until cloned embryos were created, researchers had only been successful growing human embryonic stem cells from surplus IVF embryos, which were not a genetic match with the recipient.
Melbourne stem cell researcher Professor Martin Pera said it was a major achievement that stem cells from cloned embryos made with adult cells had been obtained because animal studies had suggested younger cells were better for producing cloned embryos. ""This report shows that the same approach works with adult cells, an important advance because it proves the technique could be used on individuals to produce perfectly matched tissue for transplantation to treat disease,"" he said.

Diabetes drug a world first
AUSTRALIANS with type 1 diabetes will be the first in the world to try a new drug that stopped resultant kidney disease in mice.
The new drug is aimed at preventing kidney damage before symptoms of it appear. Up to a third of those with type 1 and 2 diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease, which often necessitates dialysis or a transplant.
About 250,000 Australians live with early-stage kidney disease. A national clinical trial on 142 diabetics with early-stage kidney disease will begin next month.
Melbourne's Monash University Professor Mark Cooper said colleague Professor Karin Jandeleit-Dahm and her team discovered three years ago that diabetics' high blood sugars activated a pathway in which a NOX enzyme caused damage to the kidneys.
Prof Cooper, who is the inaugural head of Monash's Department of Diabetes - the first such department in an Australian university - said the team found that blocking this pathway in mice stopped the kidney injury.
Studies showed the drug could also repair diabetes-related eye and heart damage. Swiss biopharmaceutical company Genkyotex is now testing its use in chronic inflammatory diseases of other organs.
""In the diabetic kidney three things happen: it scars, it gets inflamed, and it leaks the protein albumin,"" Prof Cooper said ""We were able to show this drug stopped the protein leaking, stopped the inflammation and stopped the scarring.
""It's the scarring, particularly, that causes kidney failure."" After being screened with a urine test measuring albumin levels, test subjects will be treated either with the NOX-inhibitor or with a placebo, and then tracked for a year.
The national trial, led by Melbourne's Baker Institute, is being funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund and the Australian Research Council. Diabetics who have developed kidney disease are at a 10-fold greater risk of death.
""If we can slow down kidney disease, and also reduce heart and eye disease in the diabetes population, it will dramatically improve lifespan and quality of life,"" Professor Cooper said.
""These people (sufferers of both type 1 and 2 diabetes) can avoid dialysis, have fewer heart attacks and suffer less blindness.
""The potential is great if it works."" About 1.7 million Australians have diabetes.
It is one of the biggest challenges confronting our nation's health system, growing at a faster rate than other chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which a person's pancreas stops producing insulin. While its causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved.

Speedy diabetes treatment inspired by snail's pace
The venom of a carnivorous sea snail can send an unsuspecting fish into a sugar coma but it might also inspire the next generation of ultra-fast-acting insulin for diabetics.
Biologists from the University of Utah discovered the insulin in the cone snail's venom last year. But it's taken until now for a team of Australian researchers to join their Utah counterparts and establish the insulin's three-dimensional structure and, most importantly, how it works.
Scientists will set about making an artificial version of the snail's fast-acting insulin, for use in humans. It takes up to 15 minutes for regular insulin to take effect in diabetes patients, which number about 1.7 million Australians. Walter and Eliza Hall Institute structural biologist Mike Lawrence said using the insulin found in the cone snail's venom as a model, it could become almost instantaneous in next generation insulins for patients with type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes.
""Our breakthrough has been to determine the structure of this venom insulin,"" he said. ""The 'ah-ha moment' was realising that it doesn't have the hinge mechanism that human insulin does and then working out how it gets by without it.""
In humans, insulin is a protein made up of about eight amino acids that form a hinge.
Without them, the hinge mechanism doesn't work and the insulin can't bind to the receptor on the surface of the cells. The structure of the snail venom insulin is novel: it has a small substitute for the hinge made up of just one amino acid.
The study was a collaboration involving American and Danish researchers as well as scientists from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Monash University, La Trobe University and Flinders University.
The findings are outlined in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular Biology on Tuesday.

Join the world in getting on top of diabetes
WORLD Diabetes Day is just around the corner.
This international event, celebrated on November 14 each year, raises awareness about diabetes.
This year, World Diabetes Day will focus on healthy eating, which is a key factor in managing type 1 diabetes and helping to manage and prevent type 2 diabetes.
Type 1 cannot be prevented. However, estimates suggest that type 2 can be prevented in up to 58 per cent of those individuals who are at high risk.
About 1.7 million Australians have diabetes and, of those, 85 per cent have type 2.
Many Australians, particularly those over 40, are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes through lifestyle factors such as being physically inactive and unhealthy eating.
Family history of diabetes (or genetics) also plays a role in type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of type 2 include being extremely thirsty, passing more urine, especially at night, feeling tired, always feeling hungry, having cuts that heal slowly, itching, skin infections or rashes, blurred vision, changes in weight, mood changes, headaches, cramps or tingling in the legs or feet or feeling dizzy.
Sometimes there is more than one symptom; other times there are no symptoms at all.
Often (but not always), type 2 diabetes is diagnosed in the 40s and 50s age bracket, so these symptoms are sometimes dismissed as part of ""getting older"".
How can you lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes? You cannot change such risk factors as increasing age or your family history. However, your lifestyle choices can prevent or, at least, delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
Losing some weight and reducing your waist measurement reduces your risk of type 2 diabetes.
Increasing your exercise and making healthier food choices can lower your risk. Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, along with stopping smoking, are also important considerations when reducing your diabetes risk.
Are you at risk of developing type 2 diabetes? The Australian type 2 diabetes risk assessment tool (AUSDRISK) is a short list of questions to help determine your risk of developing type 2 over the next five years, enabling you to start up a conversation with your doctor, if necessary. Designed especially for adults, you can access the AUSDRISK tool by visiting www.diabetessa.com.au/type-2/the-australian-type-2-diabetes-risk-assessment-tool.html Alternatively, why not meet Diabetes SA at Rundle Mall on Friday, November 13 between 8.30am and 2pm, where we will help to raise awareness of the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Medicare payments should be overhauled to improve care for patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases, a panel of experts has recommended.
In a discussion paper to be launched by Health Minister Sussan Ley on Wednesday, the Abbott government's national diabetes strategy advisory group says the current Medicare payment model, in which doctors get most of their income from fees paid for each patient visit, is ""unlikely to lead to optimal outcomes"".
""The fee-for-service model does not incentivise long-term follow-up or the proactive care of people with chronic conditions,"" the paper says.
The group, comprising experts from health groups, universities, research institutes and the public service, calls on the government to experiment with different payment models, which combine fee-for-service payments with other payments based on performance and patient characteristics.
The paper has been produced to kick-start a consultation process for the national diabetes strategy, and comes as the government prepares to announce a broader review of Medicare rebates.
This review, expected to be announced in coming days, would consider whether some services should be removed from the Medicare Benefits Schedule, which cost more than $19 billion last financial year. The review, which would likely be conducted at arms-length from government by an independent committee of experts, would also consider whether services are being appropriately priced, and whether some services should be more tightly targeted.
A spokesman for Ms Ley said doctors and patients had raised concerns with the government about over-testing and duplication of services.
""The government and health professionals both agree it's important we ensure patients are getting access to the most relevant, up-to-date and proven treatments and that's what we're working together to deliver,"" the spokesman said.
In 2012, the Gillard government commissioned a review of testing for vitamin D, B12 and folate deficiencies, after pathologists raised concerns about some patients being inappropriately tested. In November 2014, the Abbott government made changes to better target these items, with a likely saving of $75 million a year. But the review risks reviving hostility from professional groups which contributed to the decision to dump plans for a Medicare co-payment.
Rudd government attempts to cut payments for cataract surgery in 2009 were thwarted following an angry backlash from ophthalmologists.
The government's decision in March to jettison proposals to cut rebates for GP visits and allow doctors to recoup the loss by charging patients cost the health budget $2.1 billion. But it is understood Ms Ley is not required to produce savings of this scale.
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners President Frank Jones said ""a sustainable evidence-based funding model"" was essential, and it had developed its own model which it would put to the government shortly.
The government is inviting comments to inform the national diabetes strategy until May 17, and expects to release the strategy by the end of the year. More than 1 million Australians have diabetes.

Artificial pancreas hope for diabetics 
DIABETIC patients at seven Australian hospitals - including the Repatriation General Hospital in Daw Park - will get a ""game-changing artificial pancreas"" that automatically senses when they need insulin and pumps it into their body.
The Australian-first trial aims to determine if an artificial pancreas can stabilise patient's blood glucose levels and improve their quality of life.
It is being run by the University of Melbourne and St Vincent's Hospital. The Repat Hospital is on the list for patient recruitment.
A proof-of-concept trial of an earlier version of the artificial pancreas proved it was successful for a short period of time in a small group of patients, but this will test the new device in 120 adults over six months.
Study leader Associate Professor David O'Neal said the device was a game-changer because of its ability to automatically and precisely control glucose levels.
""This trial is to show that it can be used in everyday care at home in patients with type 1 diabetes to not only improve their blood sugar control, but translate into something meaningful for patients in terms of their sleep quality, psychological wellbeing and ability to function during the day,"" he said.
""It's not a cure for diabetes, but it lifts some of the burden on patients."" Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition where the body destroys insulin-producing cells, affects more than 120,000 Australians.
While its causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved.
When Leanne Foster was diagnosed as an 11-year-old she had to have her urine tested and use a syringe to inject insulin, but now, at 47, she is the first adult in the country to be fitted with this device.
A small sensor sits under the skin on her stomach and detects blood glucose levels, which are wirelessly transmitted to an implanted insulin pump that contains a miniature computer.
""It takes the glucose information and adjust the insulin levels every five minutes,"" Associate Prof O'Neal said.
Within days of having her artificial pancreas fitted, Mrs Foster noticed her stabilised blood glucose levels were already improving her mental health.
""I feel like the 'brain fog' from high or low sugars has lifted. This device could be life-changing for people with Type 1 diabetes,"" Mrs Foster said.
While she still has to check her levels manually to calibrate the pump and tell the device about food she eats, it means she spends less of her day monitoring and thinking about her diabetes.
If the device is shown to be effective, Associate Prof O'Neal and Mrs Foster would like to see equitable access throughout Australia to ensure as many people as possible can benefit. The trial, which will also involve 140 children in a Western Australian-led exercise, is funded by the Australian Research Council and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

Rural SA has nation's highest diabetes risk
COUNTRY South Australians have the nation's highest increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as obesity and poor exercise levels spiral out of control, research shows.
Health advocates warn that the $14.6 billion cost of the lifestyle-related illness will continue to grow without targeted prevention programs.
Data released yesterday shows that Australians with diabetes scored poorly on the Alere Wellness Index, which tracks the changing health of the nation by surveying 50,000 Australians every year.
The Roy Morgan research found that while family history and physical inactivity could double or even quadruple the risk of type 2 diabetes, severe obesity could increase the risk 42-fold for men, and a staggering 93-fold for women. Weight gain is the single most important issue driving the global type 2 diabetes epidemic.
Profiling the development of type 2 diabetes by region between 2007-2012, the index found country South Australians had the highest increased risk ratio of any region in the country. Adelaide ranked seventh on the list of 14 regions.
Zoe Mattsson, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes on her 12th birthday, wants the public to better understand the differences between type 1, an autoimmune disease which stops the pancreas from producing insulin, and type 2, the lifestyle-related condition linked to poor diet and a lack of exercise.
The Trott Park woman, 27, has been hospitalised numerous times, nearly died four times and is legally blind because of her condition.
But she wants others to know those risks can be avoided if you look after yourself, something she did not do until she neared her 20s.
""For me it's about awareness within the general public, so people don't make fun of someone because they have diabetes,"" she said.
In high school she stopped injecting insulin for about a year because she did not want to be different.
""People just didn't understand, I missed a lot of school... then I dropped out,"" she said.
At 17, she had cataract surgery on both eyes.
For Zoe that was a turning point, and while she can see most things, the plastic lenses implanted mean she cannot adjust well to light, cannot use a computer too often or drive.
She chose to cover herself in tattoos - artwork she can see.
Ms Mattsson is raising money for a cure and provide counsellors to children and teenagers.

Insurers look to rein in cost of disease
Health - Type 2 diabetes patients in hospital on the rise
Hospitals faced a surge of type 2 diabetes patients over the past three years, alarming health insurance companies about their growing medical bills.
New South Wales recorded the biggest increase, with 20 per cent more patients admitted to hospital due to type 2 diabetes in 2015 compared to 2013, according to statistics collected by Medibank on its members.
The growth in admissions was as high as 42 per cent in Sydney's central suburbs, compared to a national average increase of 15 per cent.
Medibank chief medical officer Linda Swan said the figures sent a clear signal to the health fund that it needed to staunch the spiralling cost of type 2 diabetes.
""It's not until you see the stark reality that you see this is growing at an extraordinary rate, and clearly we're not doing enough,"" Dr Swan said.
Medibank sponsors the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program, which teaches children about healthy eating in schools, and also runs a program that identifies people with chronic diseases who are at high risk of hospitalisation, and gives their GPs additional support.
Dr Swan said most type 2 diabetes hospital presentations were avoidable, but the question was how to prevent them in the most efficient way.
""We're seeing in Australia an ageing population and an increasing number of people with chronic disease, and obviously that's driving the cost of healthcare, but what we're hearing from our members is they don't want to pay more for healthcare,"" she said. ""That's the challenge our industry faces.""
Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said the disease threatened to overwhelm the viability of the national health system; there are 4400 amputations performed in hospitals each year and 10,000 admissions due to ulcers and foot sores, many of them preventable.
""Diabetes is a very significant driver of hospitalisations when you look at all of the complications,"" Professor Johnson said.
""I think health insurers are very worried because they're substantial funders of the hospitals. People with diabetes are potentially big costs to them.""
Insurers are not allowed to charge people different premiums based on their health status and they cannot refuse to insure any individual.
The Primary Health Care Advisory Group recommended last year that private insurers be encouraged to fund the prevention and management of chronic conditions, possibly through the risk equalisation pool that is used to compensate health funds with the sickest patients.
Many funds provide schemes, such as subsidised gym memberships, to reward healthy lifestyles.
Blacktown endocrinologist Glen Maberly cautioned against using hospital admissions as a measure of the growth in diabetes, because not all patients were classified as diabetics when they were admitted. This meant the real figure may be higher.
About a third of people with type 2 diabetes were undiagnosed, he said.

No-needle insulin closer for diabetics
AUSTRALIAN scientists have unravelled a 20-year mystery that could lead to the development of insulin medications for diabetics, without the need for injections.
A research team, led by the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) in Melbourne, has discovered how the insulin hormone binds to the insulin receptor, a process that scientists have been trying to solve for two decades.
Associate Professor Mike Lawrence said the new insulin products developed for diabetics had been limited by a lack of understanding of how insulin docked into its receptor.
Prof Lawrence said the latest discovery could lead to new ways to deliver insulin to diabetics other than by injection, or the development of insulin products that were more effective and longer-lasting.
He said understanding how insulin binds to its receptor was fundamental to progressing these new developments.
""What we have done is to come up with that first 3D picture of how insulin interacts with its receptor,"" Prof Lawrence said.
The insulin receptor is a large protein on the surface of cells. The binding is necessary for cells to take sugar from the blood as energy.

Fourth time the charm for pSivida
Shares in pharmaceutical developer pSivida are expected to surge today after winning access to the lucrative US market for its flagship product on the fourth attempt.
The US Food and Drug Administration has approved pSivida's Iluvien drug delivery device for the treatment of diabetic eye disease, enabling it to become commercially available next year.
The FDA had previously rejected the device three times because of fears about side effects. The product is already available in Britain and Germany, and has approval or pending approval in 17 other countries.
The US decision entitles pSivida to a $US25 million ($28.5 million) milestone payment from licensing partner Alimera Sciences.
The company will receive 20 per cent of the profits from US sales of Iluvien. It said about 560,000 Americans were estimated to have clinically significant diabetic macular edema, the leading cause of blindness in young and middle-aged adults in developed countries.
""Iluvien's clinical trials showed that Iluvien can actually reverse vision loss in many DME patients,"" pSivida chief executive Paul Ashton said.
""Another advantage of Iluvien over existing therapies is that a single injection provides sustained therapy for three years.""
Dr Ashton said the $US25 million milestone would help finance pSivida's ongoing product development program.
The company plans to seek FDA approval next year for Medidur, a similar device to Iluvien.
Dual-listed pSivida's shares closed at $4.85 on the Australian Securities Exchange on Friday.
The announcement was made after the Nasdaq market closed for the weekend.

Susannah Piek AGE: 31 Gestational diabetes 
Slim, fit and healthy, Susannah Piek does not match the stereotype of a woman likely to be hit with gestational diabetes.
And yet that was a complication for both her pregnancies - first with daughter Hazel, now four, and then with son Jay, now nine months - putting her at very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the next 20 years.
""I have gone back and done my glucose intolerance test since (having Jay) and I've got impaired glucose tolerance, so I'm in an extremely high-risk group,"" she said.
""I'm pretty much guaranteed to develop it at some point is the understanding and I'm just trying to delay it as much as possible.""
Thankfully, her pregnancies and labours progressed normally and the children were a healthy weight, however, gestational diabetes is linked to large babies and associated birth complications.
If it is not well managed the condition can cause long-term health problems in the baby, including obesity, hypertension and diabetes.
Ms Piek has committed to exercising three times a week with fitness group Mums on a Mission and healthy eating in a bid to stave off type 2 diabetes.
""It is not a diagnosis I want to get. I'm 31 so I think if I'm diagnosed with that now it gets harder and harder to manage,"" she said.
Ms Piek said there should be no stigma attached to being one of the 5 per cent of pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes.
""It's not the disease that's the issue, it's about how you deal with it; you need to focus on how you're looking after yourself and monitoring it well. It doesn't have to mean an uncomfortable pregnancy and sick babies, it just means you have to really focus on your health which is actually a good thing.""

Pharmacists join battle against type 2 diabetes 
HUNDREDS of pharmacies will join a type 2 diabetes screening program to help battle one of Australia's greatest health threats.
The $50 million initiative, involving 350 pharmacies nationwide, will be launched on the Gold Coast today by Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley.
""Early detection will include a risk assessment questionnaire to determine if someone could develop diabetes within the next five years, and may also include screening for diabetes-related health indicators through a simple finger-prick test,"" Ms Ley said.
""Based on the outcome of these checks, they may be referred to a GP."" About one million Australians have type 2 diabetes, although many more may be undiagnosed. It costs the health system about $1 billion a year.
Type 2 diabetes usually develops over the age of 45 but is becoming increasingly common in younger age groups and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. ""This model allows pharmacists, who have high levels of contact with the community, to identify and refer patients to a GP,"" Ms Ley said.

Review risk to diabetics
DIABETES experts have accused the Gillard Government of trying to restrict access to treatments.
The Federal Government is reviewing access to type 2 diabetes treatments listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to evaluate their effectiveness, clinical evidence and cost.
But Prof Paul Zimmet, from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, fears the review will see patients denied a new generation of drugs that can better manage the disease.
""While they claim the objective is to improve the health outcomes for people who have diabetes, it looks more like a cost-saving exercise,"" he said.
""For most people with type 2 diabetes, over the course of their illness there is an increasing number of drugs being needed including insulin, and the impact of restricting access to some of these newer drugs means people are much more likely to develop complications: eye disease, kidney disease, amputations.
""The long-term costs of this are likely to be greater than the cost savings of restricting the drugs.""
Kristen Hazelwood, of the Australian Diabetes Council, said individuals were better suited to different treatments, and removing some drugs from the PBS under the review would lead to complications for many.
The Department of Health and Ageing review will accept submission until July 2.

'Diabesity' a killer-in-waiting
THE horror heart attack days of the 1960s have returned, with a new report warning Australians are headed for a renewed epidemic of heart disease fuelled by twin threats of obesity and diabetes.
A combination of the two conditions, dubbed ""diabesity"", has seen a resurgence of heart disease as Australia's number one killer and wiped out many of the gains made to overcome spiralling rates of heart attacks and stroke over the past 50 years, a report from Melbourne's medical research facility Baker IDI concludes.
After five decades of improvements, the number of heart disease deaths has flattened over the past five years and now appear to be reversing, with a rise in fatalities recorded this year for the first time in a decade.
With cardiovascular disease now affecting more than 3.7 million Australians and accounting for 45,000 deaths a year, Baker IDI director Prof Tom Marwick warns that cardiovascular complacency is a killer.
""The consequences of the obesity epidemic are going to turn into more diabetes, and that is already happening. The most common serious consequence of diabetes is cardiovascular, heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease,"" Prof Marwick said. ""Back in the 1950-60s the frequency of type 2 diabetes was much less, and people had coronary disease from their smoking and stuff like that. ""That problem is less than what it was, but unfortunately the diabetes problem is more and in addition to heart attacks and stroke it is going to drive a bunch of other things too."" Over the past 50 years, life expectancy for Australians has risen by a decade, with about 70 per cent of the improvement attributed to lower deaths from heart attacks, stroke and blood vessel disease. However, the impact of obesity and type 2 diabetes were reversing the trend.

Short bursts of exercise helps regulate type 2 diabetes, research shows
Short bursts of exercise between periods of sitting down can help people with type 2 diabetes regulate their condition, new research has found. Melbourne's Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute study compared blood sugar levels of adults who did three minutes of light walking or simple stretches for every half an hour they were seated, against their glucose readings for a day in which they remained inactive. Researchers found test subjects had significantly lower - and therefore improved - blood sugar readings when they did the occasional exercise. The results of which are being presented at a meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine on Friday. Mechanic Steve Aumann (pictured), said being involved in the study made him more conscious about breaking up the times he spent seated with more physical activity. ""I became more conscious about varying the times I sat and did nothing and the times I moved around, which is quite good,"" he said.

This little fairy's life turns around
At first glance, four-year-old Anna Kastner looks like any other little girl dressed in a fairy outfit, drawing pictures with her felt pens.
Mum Nicki, like most parents, is clearly adoring of her daughter. An outside observer would never know the trauma they have been through over the past two years since Anna's diabetes diagnosis.
Nicki Kastner has spoken out about the challenge of her daughter's disease to improve awareness of the condition.
It has been an arduous journey, which started when two-year-old Anna was rushed to hospital where she spent two weeks, including time in a high dependency ward.
""She was so ill she did not even flinch as they put a cannula in her arm,"" Mrs Kastner says through tears, the memory bringing back the fear she felt that day.
From then her parents had a crash-course in the effects of Type 1 diabetes ranging from insulin dosage and administration to what to do if their toddler went into a life-threatening ""hypo"" if her blood sugar levels drop, or soar.
Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease caused by a gene disorder and cannot be reversed. It is commonly confused with Type 2 diabetes, which is a metabolic disorder, and can be managed with the help of lifestyle changes.
To help her cope, and to help support other families, Mrs Kastner has started a Facebook page This Fairy wants to Fly - Living With Childhood Type 1 Diabetes, and also has a blog.
One of the biggest challenges her family faces is the lack of understanding in the community, from doctors to family, of not only the seriousness of the disease but what a struggle it is to manage from day to day.
Every night for the past two years she has woken at least every two hours to do a finger-prick test on Anna's blood sugar levels and has to decide if the levels are safe. She also does about 10 finger-prick tests during each day.
""There is a weight of responsibility that is carried which few people understand,"" Mrs Kastner says.
""The relentlessness of wondering what might be around the next corner, and will she grow up to be happy and healthy - it is really hard."" Anna has had many trips to hospital and what might be an unpleasant case of gastro for some, any illness involving vomiting can quickly become life-threatening for a child with type 1 diabetes.
In Tasmania, the incidence of Type 1 in young people has increased almost fourfold, from 85 cases in 2006 to 355 cases this year, but Diabetes Tasmania chief executive Traci Lonergan says reasons for the increase are not known.
Like all Type 1 diabetes patients, the management of Anna's insulin is a constant.
Initially, Anna needed at least seven injections daily to maintain healthy insulin levels but now uses an insulin pump, which helps.
Registered nurse and insulin pump trainer Liz Broad provides support and advice through the Hobart Private Hospital and says each patient has a unique experience from diagnosis to treatment.
A diverse range of patients can use the pumps, aged from two years and up. In the past 18 months, Ms Broad says there has been a sharp rise in the uptake of the therapy, which she believes is because of increased public awareness about diabetes, advances in technology and easier access to the equipment.
""Particularly in children, where the required dose of insulin can be very, very small, the pumps can make life so much easier,"" she says.
""The effects of diabetes go past the physical risks to the emotional toll of constantly having to be wary and the whole family must also bear the burden in some way.
Today is Diabetes Australia Walk to Work Day in a bid to raise funds to reduce the incidence of diabetes and promote better physical, mental and social health.

Potatoes linked to pregnancy risk
Amanda Donney knows what diabetes looks like. Her father had it and she's worried her children might also be at risk of the disease. Now pregnant with her first child, she's aware of the risks of eating too many starchy foods. ""There's a lot on what you shouldn't be eating. The doctors tell you 'don't eat this, don't eat that',"" she said. But new research published this week in the British Medical Journal has found that women who eat more than five servings of potato a week before becoming pregnant are more likely to develop gestational diabetes while carrying the baby. The research, conducted over 10 years and with thousands of test subjects, concluded that even diets of seemingly innocuous foods like french fries or potato mash are associated with increased risk for pregnant women. ""I've tried to fix a diet by eating healthy but I've sort of let myself go a bit,"" Ms Donney said. ""I've tried to stay away from all the foods they tell me not to eat. They say not to eat ham and sushi. I haven't gone anywhere near sushi."" But she isn't alone. With a lot of dietary information out there, sometimes choosing the right things to eat before and during pregnancy can be tricky, especially if it requires specialty ingredients.
""I try to look at how many certain foods I should be having each day, and how much protein and how much carbs and all that,"" she said. But according to Professor Linda Tapsell, of the University of Wollongong, women like Ms Donney have no reason to be alarmed by the research. Even though potatoes are singled out in the study, the link between potato consumption and gestational diabetes is not causal. ""It's very important to note that potatoes don't cause diabetes,"" she said. ""While [the study] might come across as a negative story on potatoes, in my mind it's really supporting the moderation component. ""There are a lot of foods women need to be vigilant about. They need to be eating nutritious foods and vegetables. We've been saying moderation and balance all along, and particularly in the area of diabetes."" Professor Tapsell said the key was eating a variety of vegetables. ""For me, it doesn't tell me that potatoes are bad, it just tells me when we're thinking of vegetables, we're not thinking of just potatoes. They're suggesting wholegrains and legumes as well, and that's moving into things like quinoa, lentils and chickpeas. [The study] is there to put evidence behind that message of moderation and balance.""

Feared BPA in our bodies
SYDNEY: Australians' body fluids are laced with BPA,
according to a researcher who believes the plastic chemical adds to the risk of type 2 diabetes.
""There is BPA in Australians' urine,"" said Professor Dianna Magliano, who is analysing samples taken from 3000 Australians.
BPA is a controversial chemical with possible hormone-disrupting effects. Although experts disagree about how safe or dangerous it might be, Prof Magliano is firmly in the danger camp.
""There is strong evidence supporting that BPA causes a risk of diabetes in mice, monkeys and rats,"" she said yesterday ahead of giving a presentation at the World Diabetes Congress in Melbourne.
""In 2008, a US study showed the amount of BPA in urine correlates with the risk of diabetes, obesity and heart disease. It is not clear whether the diabetes or plastic came first.""
Prof Magliano, from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, is analysing data collected from an Ausdiab study of thousands of Australian diabetics since 2000.
""I am analysing whether BPA in the urine of Australians can predict people's risk of developing diabetes over time,"" she said.
""I have not got the answer yet, but I expect it to be positive. Like the Americans, the Europeans and Koreans, we have BPA in our urine.""
She said there had been a push for baby products to be made without BPA because people tended to scrub them hard and break down their integrity, causing BPA to leach into food.
Only BPA-free plastic should be used in the microwave, she said, but it was much better to use glass.
""There is enough stuff in our life that gives us diabetes. We don't need to increase our risk,"" she said.
""The biggest type 2 diabetes risk is obesity.""
BPA is in many products, including till slips and canned foods.

Urgent call for patients Diabetes vaccine trial
A $10 MILLION world-first trial using a nasal spray vaccine to prevent Type 1 diabetes is struggling to recruit patients, despite researchers proving its effectiveness in bolstering immune response to the disease.
More than 9000 people in Australia, New Zealand and Germany have been screened over six years to determine their eligibility for the trial.
But only 84 people have been deemed at high enough risk of developing the disease to take part.
The study, run by Royal Melbourne Hospital and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, needs another 37 participants who are close relatives of a Type 1 diabetes patient.
Professor Len Harrison said the vaccine had great potential, but they were under great pressure to recruit all the patients by the end of the year.
""It's a new form of vaccination that's a little bit different from how we normally conceive a vaccination, but it's really about switching off a bad immune response,"" Prof Harrison said.
In Type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the pancreas cells that produce insulin, which regulates the conversion of sugars in food into energy.
The vaccine aims to dampen the immune system's attack on the insulin cells and let the body make its own insulin, eradicating the need for daily injections.
Last year, in a concurrent study, they showed the nasal vaccine induced protection against an immune response to insulin.
""It's a very exciting finding because if we can't show tolerance to insulin introduced from the outside, we couldn't really expect to see tolerance to insulin made inside the body,"" Prof Harrison said.
Rebecca Infanti is a third generation Type 1 diabetes patient, and had both her children screened to take part in the study.
Her 10-year-old daughter Angela was found to have antibodies, putting her at high risk of developing the disease within five years, and she will use the nasal spray as part of the trial.
""It was pretty heartbreaking when we found out she was at risk, but we're also so grateful to know we can do everything we can to try and help prevent it,"" Ms Infanti said.
""She's pretty excited to know she could be part of ground-breaking research.""

Rose's rush of blood an infusion of hope for diabetes cure
IT SEEMS impossible: a potential cure for an unpreventable, incurable disease that so dramatically impacts a person's life.
But 12-year-old Rose Boon is living proof of a possible medical miracle. Having tested positive for the early markers of Type 1 Diabetes at age five, she is the first South Australian - and only the third patient in the world - to be reinfused with her own, stored umbilical cord blood as part of a world-first, Australian study that is aiming to prevent T1D entirely.
Last week, Rose laid back in her hospital bed in Sydney's Children's Hospital at Westmead, her family watching on, as her body was infused with her own cord blood, stored for more than a decade; now a potential cure.
Mother Jenny said Rose - the youngest of four children - tested positive for the onset of T1D seven years ago, which followed the diagnosis of her eldest son, Sam, now aged 22, when he was only three.
""(Sam's diagnosis) was a complete shock and from that point, we were always looking for any research that might help him.... when Rose was born, we froze her cord blood, with the intention that it would potentially help Sam,"" she said.
Little did she know that this blood would in fact help her daughter. ""Rose became double antibody positive when she was five,"" Mrs Boon said.
""She's currently disease-free, but because she has the two antibodies, she had a 50 per cent likelihood of developing T1D within two years.
""She's seven years down the track... she's a bit on borrowed time."" Paediatric endocrinologist at The Children's Hospital Westmead Professor Maria Craig said the study was looking at reinfusing a child's stored cord blood into their system at the first sign of T1D in the hope it would reset the recipient's immune system.
Cord blood is that which remains in the placenta and the attached umbilical cord after childbirth and is a particularly rich source of stem cells.
The study - named CORD (Cord blood Reinfusion in Diabetes) - has been recruiting participants aged between one and 14 whose relatives have T1D and who have stored cord blood. The first child, a four-year-old from Western Australia, was infused with her cord blood in May 2015.
Rose said she felt good after receiving her cord blood.
""I'm excited because it also might help other people with the research,"" she said.
She will now undergo three-monthly blood tests to see what affect the treatment has had.
Australia has one of the highest rates of T1D in the world, with around 130,000 people living with the condition. Rose's umbilical cord blood was cryogenically stored with organisation Cell Care, which is also financially supporting the study. It costs $3175 to store cord blood for 18 years.

Dealing with the condition since her late teens and determined to live a full life since, Ms Williams said that in 1940s England diabetes was a potentially fatal diagnosis.
But on the 60th anniversary of Diabetes Tasmania, Ms Williams gave thanks to modern medical technology that allowed diabetics to lead normal lives.
""Diabetes today is nothing like the burden it was when I was first diagnosed,"" Ms Williams said.
""My father also had diabetes and my grandfather lost his legs due to the disease, and when I was diagnosed I spent three months in hospital.
""While there I saw diabetics come in in comas, and later be taken away by the mortuary men. It was events like this that made me realise how serious a thing the condition was."" In her first years of treatment, Ms Williams faced injecting herself with pig, cow or sheep insulin via a huge needle on a glass syringe, with the equipment kept submerged in methylated spirits between uses.
For Ms Williams, who enjoyed a full working life and looks after herself by making precautionary visits to the podiatrist every six weeks, said diabetes never slowed her down. ""It's not a life sentence, just a way of life."" An updated Australian Diabetes Map shows Tasmania has the third-highest rate among states and territories.
The Tasman municipality is the state's diabetes hotspot, where it affects 6.48 per cent of the population, followed by Dorset (6.30), Derwent Valley (6.22), Glenorchy (6.10), and Burnie (6.02).
Diabetes Tasmania CEO Caroline Wells said there was plenty of work to be done in diabetic care.
Ms Wells said diabetes was on track to be the leading burden of disease by 2017.""In Tasmania we have over 27,000 people diagnosed with diabetes, 10,000 people living with the disease but undiagnosed, and 45,000 Tasmanians at high risk - which equates to around 16 per cent of the state's population,"" she said.

His charity keeps giving
LOU Richards' charity continued even in death with more than $20,000 raised in his honour to fight type 1 diabetes - a disease suffered by his great-grandson Jack.
Instead of flowers at his farewell yesterday, Lou had asked for donations to be made to the Type 1 Foundation.
Hundreds of donations were made through the day yesterday, and they continued to flow late last night.
The charity's chairman, Peter Goss, is the doctor to Lou's great-grandson, eight-year-old Jack, who has had the illness for three years.
""Lou has always been very touched by Jack's diagnosis,"" foundation director Ange Liston-McCaughley said.
""He was quoted as saying that he wished he could give type 1 diabetes to himself and take it off Jack.
""It's a lifelong disease that not a lot of people know about."" Unlike type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes is not caused by diet and it currently does not have a cure.
The Type 1 Foundation aims to enhance the lives of children with the disease. The donations made in Lou's honour will be used to build an online training module to help staff safely give insulin injections to children in Australian schools.

Diabetic vision loss a hefty toll; Eye disease hits economy
Diabetic eye disease will cost Australians more than $2billion in lost productivity and ill health this year, according to a new Deloitte Access Economics report. The report, published on Tuesday, found vision loss associated with diabetes had a broad impact throughout the Australian economy and community, with most sufferers of working age. According to the report, close to 72,000 Australians suffer from diabetic macular oedema (DME); a common cause of vision loss linked to diabetes that is both preventable and treatable. ""It is estimated that at least 50per cent of people with diabetes do not access regular eye tests according to national guidelines,"" the report said. ""If nothing is done to address this growing problem it is estimated that in the next 15 years, the number of people with DME will increase by 42 per cent."" Ophthalmologist Dr Randev Mendis, who runs a private practice in Deakin and conducts sessions at the Canberra Hospital, said DME was a consequence of diabetes that caused blood vessels in the eye to leak. ""All diabetics are liable to get it although those who have had diabetes for a long time are especially likely,"" he said. ""Diabetics may not be entirely aware of the condition and that's why retina screening is such an important health intervention, as small changes may not be appreciated by the individual"" The Deloitte report found the emotional and social burden of DME resulted in enormous costs to the government and taxpayer. ""In 2015, the total indirect cost of vision loss associated with DME is estimated to be $2.07billion, which corresponds to $28,729 per person with DME,"" the report said.
Lead partner of the study Lynne Pezzullo, who works with Deloitte's Health Economics and Social Policy department, said the total figure was not a surprise given the nature of the condition. Ms Pezzullo said the indirect economic costs of DME totalled $624.3million while the loss of welfare - or a social value of a loss in the stock of health capital - amounted to $1.4billion. ""A significant part of this cost is associated with a loss of wellbeing and because people of working age could not work or could not work at full capacity due of poor vision caused by DME,"" the report said. ""On average, DME patients with poor vision suffer a disability equivalent to losing approximately one- and-a-half months out of every year because they are not in perfect health."" The report found the $2.7billion figure may be understated as the study did not include costs associated with informal care, lower productivity at work, and welfare payments. Ms Pezzullo said her interest in the avoidable cost of diabetes and associated health impacts was partly motivated by personal interests. ""I have a son with type 1 diabetes so this is very important to me and shows the impact this has on a personal level,"" she said. ""It's a matter of making sure you get your eyes checked every two years to make sure a diagnosis can be made early."" Researcher Dr Peter van Wijngaarden, a fellow with the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists, said diabetes was the leading cause of vision loss in Australia and could be avoided with early detection. ""Diabetes is an epidemic in Australia at the moment and we think the number of people known to have a diagnosis is around 1.2million,"" he said.

Lifestyle key to lower risk
The male sex hormone testosterone may prove to be an important piece in the prevention puzzle when it comes to type 2 diabetes. Up to 58 per cent of type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented in the high risk or pre-diabetes population, according to Diabetes Australia.
The best way to do this is by adopting a healthy lifestyle - eating healthy foods, exercising regularly and maintaining weight within the healthy range. However, most people at risk find this a hard ask.
Now, a large-scale study believed to be the biggest randomised controlled trial of testosterone ever undertaken worldwide, is investigating whether testosterone, in combination with lifestyle changes, may improve the chances of those most vulnerable to type 2 diabetes.
Two of the six trial centres across Australia are in Perth, one at Fremantle Hospital and the other at the Keogh Institute of Medical Research at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. A recruitment drive for volunteers is underway.
Endocrinologist Bu Yeap, one of the principal investigators for the Testosterone for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Men at High Risk trial (T4DM), said testosterone was known to play a role, not just in men's fertility and libido, but in their overall health.
""We know that the lower the testosterone, the poorer the health outcomes seem to be,"" he said.
Testosterone helps in building muscle mass, fat loss and reducing insulin resistance but, as men age, levels tend to drop. Being overweight and obesity are also associated with reduced levels of testosterone.
Participants in the trial, funded by a $4.5 million National Health and Medical Research grant, are given free access to weight-loss program Weight Watchers, three monthly health check-ups and treatment with either testosterone or a placebo.
The testosterone and the placebo are delivered via injections given at enrolment, six weeks later and then every 12 weeks for two to four years.
The testosterone injections are expected to boost levels by about 15-20/Lnmols, enough to put those low in the hormone back into the normal range.
Professor Yeap said volunteering for the trial could be a benefit for those involved regardless of whether they received the testosterone or the placebo. ""Men in the placebo arm still get the lifestyle intervention and regular health check-ups and are likely to benefit from that in any case. In fact, if those men lose their excess weight, their own production of testosterone would increase,"" he said.
Professor Yeap said in addition to the primary outcome in relation to diabetes prevention, the trial would also answer questions about the safety and tolerability of testosterone in middle-aged and older men.
Side effects of testosterone treatment can include acne, pain at the injection site, coughing and in some men a temporary reduction in sperm count. Almost one quarter of Australians have diabetes or are at risk and it is the nation's fastest-growing chronic condition.

Health wrap diabetes centre lead
The Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre has been set up to support families facing the daily challenges of living with the condition.
General manager Rebecca Johnson said it was the first diabetes centre in Australia to focus on peer and psychosocial support, acknowledging that mental health and family dynamics played an important role in how a child coped with type 1 diabetes.
Ms Johnson said the centre had been six years in the making, with board chairman Jeff Newman the driving force.
""Jeff anchored Telethon for 38 years and during that time he spent a lot of time with sick kids in WA, and noticed that there was a real need for better support for children with type 1 diabetes,"" she said of the former Seven Perth weather presenter.
""The vision is for a type 1 hub in the community, where we can help kids directly but also look out for their families - mums, dads and siblings - because every member of the family is important in keeping a child with type 1 happy and healthy.""
The centre provides support services, information and education and clinical care in a community, rather than a hospital, setting.
Ms Johnson, who was diagnosed with type 1 at 17 before undertaking a law degree, has drawn upon her own experiences in her role.
""Empathy is the most powerful tool to use in my job - I get it, I've walked that road, it's a lonely road, it's tough,"" she said.
""Knowing that sense of isolation that you feel when you live with an invisible disease like type 1, the aim is to create an informed and connected type 1 community. It is so important to feel connected. We want this to be a community space, a warm and friendly place that is family-friendly.""
The centre will work alongside PMH, which provides medical care and management to children with type 1 diabetes, and will host some of its northern clinics.
It was also working on delivering online intervention programs related to emotional wellness and mental health.
Ms Johnson said its website ensured that regional families didn't miss out.
""The needs in the type 1 community change across the age groups and we want to be able to support kids along the journey all the way through as their needs shift,"" she said.
A person with type 1 diabetes faces a daily regimen balancing insulin injections, blood-sugar testing, diet adjustments and physical activity. This, combined with the constant threat of the risks associated with high or low blood-glucose levels, places a major strain on the child and their family.
""This is a complex chronic disease, kids never get a day off from it and it really impacts families,"" Ms Johnson said.
""We are raising awareness not only of the medical regimen of daily injections and testing but the general health side of things, finding the motivation every day to get up and face the challenge of this demanding disease.
""It was a couple of years before I came to terms with the permanence of this. Yet it's the most powerfully positive thing in my life; it not only helped me focus on nutrition and healthy eating, it's also directed my career.""

A piece of the action
Exercise can be complicated for some diabetics but there are ways to manage the risks.
Five years ago, designer Matthew Beattie was dedicating four evenings each week to Latin dancing - a mix of merengue and salsa that kept him fit and gave him a social life. That was until the 36-year-old, who has type 1 diabetes, found it so hard to control his blood sugar levels that he quit dancing. Sometimes his blood sugar dropped dangerously low, a problem called hypoglycaemia that can cause fits, comas or even death. At other times it rose too high, which can seriously damage kidneys and eyes over time.
""The fear of blood sugar going too high or too low is something only another person with type 1 can understand,"" says Beattie, one of 140,000 Australians with the disease. ""If you exercise very intensely it can cause blood sugar to drop too low at night and there's a risk of falling into a coma while you sleep.""
We hear a lot about type 2 diabetes and exercise - the bad news about how physical inactivity makes us sitting ducks for this disease and the good news that exercise helps manage it if it develops. But despite the similar name, type 1 diabetes is a different disease caused when the immune system attacks the pancreas, crippling its ability to produce insulin to control blood sugar levels.
Australia has one of the highest rates of type 1 diabetes in the world and for anyone who has it, exercise can be a double-edged sword, endocrinologist Stephen Twigg, from the University of Sydney, says.
""Exercise has important benefits because it reduces the risk of heart disease, and having diabetes increases this risk. But for people with type 1, exercise can also make blood glucose levels go very high or very low. It's challenging to balance it. If someone with type 1 pushes themselves very hard with exercise, for instance, it can increase levels of stress hormones. This in turn can raise blood glucose levels - it's a nightmare for parents with children who want to play sport,"" he says.
But Beattie is back on the dance floor thanks to an online education program called exT1D that teaches people with type 1 diabetes how to manage their blood sugar better so they can feel confident about exercising.
""There are so many variables that affect blood sugar with type 1 diabetes including how hot or cold it is, the amount of carbs you eat or how intensely you exercise. It's a juggling act requiring constant blood glucose monitoring - if you drop one of the balls, everything comes undone,"" Beattie says. ""But this has made it easier for me to manage all the variables.""
Developed by Allan Bolton, an accredited exercise physiologist, the program works by teaching people with type 1 diabetes to predict the impact of different types of exercise and sport on their blood glucose levels so they can manage these levels more effectively when they exercise.
Feedback on exT1D has been so positive the University of Sydney's Medical School and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital's Diabetes Centre are evaluating its effectiveness with a randomised control trial.
Bolton, who has type 1 diabetes, says more than 50 per cent of people with the condition avoid exercise because they fear the consequences. He created exT1D by combining his knowledge of exercise science with 30 years of learning to balance his own blood sugar so he could take part in endurance events.
""Most people newly diagnosed with type 1 are under 15 so the program also provides a way for parents to grasp the complexities of exercising with type 1 and help kids develop a healthy relationship with physical activity for life,"" he says.

Fred's vision still pushing indigenous healthcare
INDIGENOUS people who are at risk of becoming blind because of diabetes are receiving world-class healthcare for the first time.
An initiative funded by the Fred Hollows Foundation and rolled out this week now means that when indigenous patients - often from remote communities - come in to a health clinic, a retinal camera will send images for examination to a centre in Melbourne.
Rather than wait weeks or months, the results are sent back to doctors within two days.
Tele-retinal imaging, which aims to prevent disease through early detection, has been set up in health clinics in remote parts of Australia such as Miwatj, in East Arnhem Land, about 1000km east of Darwin. Routine screening has also started in Alice Springs and Katherine.
Fred Hollows Foundation chief executive Brian Doolan said the technology was the next big jump in the delivery of health services to indigenous Australians since Hollows's time. ""It puts the best of technology right into the hands of Aboriginal healthcare workers, the people right on the frontline,"" he said.
Alicia Jenkins, professor of diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Sydney and one of the experts who has developed the technology, said: ""This dramatically improves the turnaround time of the results... this is a wonderful use of technology to overcome the remote location and shortage of doctors in the region.
""There has been a huge need for this for some time.""
The imaging process is just one aspect of the $3 million TEAMSnet program being rolled out by the Hollows foundation in partnership with the universities of Sydney and Melbourne, and other Australian institutions.
The project also features a hi-tech electronic medical record system aimed at preventing chronic disease. When the doctor or health worker enters a patient's name, every test the patient has undergone is displayed.
This includes cholesterol levels, blood pressure, X-rays and any recommendations made by dieticians or health workers about their health and weight.
James Bray, 72, is a retired technology consultant who loves to paint in the style of Albert Namatjira. Mr Bray was born and bred in Alice Springs and was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 49.
""I love painting so much,"" he said yesterday. ""Now that I'm retired, I have much more time for it, so if I have poor sight, my life would be so much harder. In my life, it is eyes first, heart second.""
When Mr Bray came in to the health clinic at Alice Springs yesterday, the retinal photographs identified significant damage to the macula, the most important part of the retina.
His case was escalated to ""urgent"" and was referred to Alice Springs Hospital for treatment. If the damage had gone unmanaged, Mr Bray's vision loss could have been rapid and harder to salvage.
Laima Brazionis, the TEAMSnet program director, said: ""We encourage people who have diabetes to have these check-ups - which are far less time-consuming and stressful than the average eye examination - because they prevent blindness in so many.""
The new program is also being run in partnership with the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory.

ASK THE NATUROPATH...
My uncle has had diabetes for many years. His doctor has said he needs to improve his circulation. Is there anything natural that could help?
When you hear anything about circulation it's usually confined to the big guns: the major arteries, veins and, of course, the heart. These larger vessels branch out into ever diminishing tributaries called arterioles, venules, capillaries and the lymphatics, which are collectively known as the body's microcirculation.
It's these finer branches of circulation, the teensy-weensy blood vessels and lymphatics, that are responsible for the hard yakka of delivering nutrients including oxygen to target tissues such as the brain, liver and muscles, as well as the nerves, eyes, kidneys and the extremities such as your feet.
These latter destinations suffer when circulation is poor, and this is of primary concern to people diagnosed with diabetes (both type 1 and 2), in which decreased microcirculation is a common symptom.
If left untreated, these complications can be dire and may result in leg ulcers, erectile dysfunction, kidney failure or blindness.
HERBS FOR CIRCULATION
For hundreds of years, traditional herbal remedies such as garlic, hawthorn, ginkgo, dan shen, bilberry, chilli and ginger have been used to improve circulation. The naturally-occurring chemical nitric oxide also helps to widen blood vessels, improving circulation (see box, above).
In addition to blood flow, the health and integrity of the blood vessel walls, the endothelium, is vital. Injured endothelium increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Herbs and supplements that are helpful in improving endothelial health include: grape seed extract, bilberry, gotu kola, ascorbic acid and quercetin.
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT
Exercise, particularly the kind that makes the heart pump harder, improves circulation.
Whether it's walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, do an activity you enjoy regularly.
Yoga poses (asanas) benefit the circulation in other ways. For the pavanmuktasana pose, lie on the floor or bed, hugging both knees in towards your chest; the flexing of both knee and hip joints causes a temporary reduction in blood flow. As you release the pose, fresh blood rushes back to the area, flushing away toxins and providing fresh nutrients and oxygen.
Inverted postures, where the head is below the heart, encourages blood flow to the brain.
You don't need to go to the extremes of a headstand or handstand; instead lie with your legs up a wall, with your bottom and hips raised on a pillow or a rolled-up towel.

Health sitting research
Research into sitting - how much we do, why it causes chronic health problems and what we can do to fix it - is still in its infancy but Australia is leading the way.
David Dunstan, Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute physical activity laboratory head, has spent most of his career studying sedentary behaviour and was part of a panel to make the first tentative time guidelines, released last month in the UK, around sitting and standing at work.
His work has helped identify the health advantages of breaking up prolonged sitting time with short bursts of activity.
A series of studies, whose subjects were overweight or obese or had type 2 diabetes, compared prolonged, uninterrupted sitting with prolonged sitting interrupted by intermittent bouts of activity. These demonstrated substantially improved blood glucose levels throughout the day for the more active group.
""It doesn't appear to matter about the intensity of the movement, as long as you are moving,"" Professor Dunstan said.
He said not enough was known about all the mechanisms that made sitting such a risk for chronic health conditions.
""When we sit for long hours on end we are getting reduced blood flow throughout the body. Muscular contraction is so important for helping regulate many of the body's metabolic processes, like clearance of blood glucose and clearance of blood fat,"" he said.
""We know that spikes in glucose throughout the day are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, so the more you can dampen those spikes in glucose the lower your risk for cardiovascular disease.""
Professor Dunstan said intervention studies were needed to provide the definitive evidence that if you changed a person's sedentary time you could achieve better outcomes.
""There's some encouraging signs from studies internationally that if the intervention is targeted to reducing sedentary time - the amount of time spent sitting - that appears more favourable than interventions that target exercise or physical activity,"" he said.
""What that highlights to us is that if we are to have a comprehensive approach to getting people to exercise more and reduce their sitting we have to have interventions that target both those specific behaviours.""
Professor Leon Straker, from Curtin University's school of physiotherapy, is keen to measure just how much time workers spend sitting and find ways that they can meet their productive targets without being sedentary.
One study he was involved with used accelerometers to show that Perth office workers spent three-quarters of their time sedentary.
""A lot of the initial interventions: going for a walk at lunchtime or walking more steps at work, they are health beneficial but not productive. If you have a deadline coming they are the things that are going to disappear,"" he said.
Simply swapping sitting for standing was not the answer, as static standing had long been associated with its own set of problems, including back pain, leg discomfort and fatigue.
""What we know from cardiometabolic risks and what we think is probably true from musculoskeletal risk as well is that four hours straight sitting in one bout is more damaging to your health than eight
30-minute blocks of sitting,"" Professor Straker said.
Sit/stand desks were a good way to encourage that.
But providing the equipment alone was not enough, it had to be accompanied by a campaign to teach people about the risks of too much sitting.
""When we did an intervention with sit/stand desks plus support within an organisation to change work practices, they were able to get a 2 1/2 hour difference between people sitting less and standing more during the day which is really substantial change,"" Professor Straker said. ""However, people can't stand for long periods of time without getting discomfort and standing isn't really moving much still, so it is a good interim solution. In the longer term we are going to look at the ways we can actually move more while we are working, and while we are working with computers.""
Professor Straker has been examining the viability of treadmill and under-desk cycling.
In standing versus sitting desks there is no loss in keyboard performance. A walking desk is associated with a small loss in speed and performance - the average typing speed dropped from 55 to 50 words a minute.
Cycling was much closer to sitting and standing with less of a loss in productivity.

At home
Do household chores such as folding the washing while standing and watching TV.
Take phone calls and read the newspaper standing up.
Get off the couch and move around during commercial breaks.
At work
Stand and take a break from your computer every 30 minutes.
Use the stairs not the elevator.
Stand during phone calls.
Use a height-adjustable workstation.
Use a communal bin rather than one at your desk so you have to get up to dispose of rubbish.
Eat lunch away from your desk.
Out and about
Use public transport - stand while on it and get off one station early for the walk.
Walk or cycle to your destination.

Why we need to sit less and move more
Sitting for eight hours a day increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer by 40 per cent.
After 90 minutes of continuous sitting your metabolism slows down: lipoprotein lipase, enzymes that break down fat, slow down by 90 per cent.
People considered to be ""high sitters"" have double the risk of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes, a 13 per cent increased risk of cancer and 17 per cent risk of mortality compared with ""low sitters"".
Every additional hour of television viewing per day is linked to a 10 per cent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a 7.5 per cent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
For those who sit seven hours a day, every additional hour of watching television adds 5 per cent to their risk of premature mortality.
The more people sit at work, the more likely they are to sit at home.
When standing you burn 50 more calories per hour than you do while sitting.
Even people who meet the physical activity guidelines for exercise can rack up long sitting times and be vulnerable to the associated risks.

Dutton pumps up diabetes aid
HEALTH Minister Peter Dutton has accused the former Rudd-Gillard government of never delivering on promises to fund more insulin pumps for children with type 1 diabetes.
Despite a pre-election pledge by Tanya Plibersek in June, Mr Dutton said the promised money never turned up to help families. But Mr Dutton said he had now resolved the issue.
A new funding allocation of $1.4 million will provide insulin pump subsidies for an extra 136 children under the Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Pump program.
""Unfortunately for the children who urgently needed this subsidy, Labor could not deliver on its promise. For three months children have been deprived of this financial assistance, but as soon as I became minister, I met with the JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) and within 10 days the Government made the money available,"" Mr Dutton said. ""It will at least be one less worry for families under enormous pressure."" He said insulin pumps could cost from $4500 to $9500, a huge expense for families. The new program will cover 80 per cent of the cost.
""Having access to these small devices... means that these children will avoid up to seven injections or more each day, which is painful and makes life so much harder."" Mr Dutton will take part in the Walk to Cure Diabetes event today in Brisbane.

Exam relief for diabetic pupils
In a major win for students with type 1 diabetes, WA education authorities will give them extra time to do their Year 12 exams.
Diabetes educators have welcomed the decision, arguing that until now stressed students faced unfair requirements to ""prove"" their diabetes put them at a disadvantage.
At present, diabetic students can take insulin and food into exams but generally are not allowed extra time.
But after lobbying from the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre, the School Curriculum and Standards Authority has agreed to give students an extra 10 minutes for each hour of their ATAR exams.
There are 1200 children with type 1 diabetes in WA and the policy change is likely to flow on to other States.
Diabetes centre chief executive Bec Johnson said the new provisions were expected to be in place for this year's exams.
While students still needed to apply for the special considerations, they would only require a letter from their doctor confirming they had diabetes.
Ms Johnson said in the past students had been able to ask to ""stop the clock"" while they attended to diabetes management, such as giving themselves insulin, but they had not been given extra time to work on their exams.
This was despite their focus often being broken by having to manage their diabetes.
Ms Johnson said students had faced onerous requirements if they wanted extra time.
""If they applied, they had to submit to two extra exams to prove they needed it and we view this as similar to asking a person in a wheelchair to prove they can't run,"" she said.

Health wrap diabetes workshops
Finding the right information and support can help type 1 diabetes families navigate their way through the highs and lows.
The Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre - established to ensure families feel connected, informed and equipped to handle the challenges - offers workshops, information sessions and speaker events.
Centre general manager Rebecca Johnson said families were encouraged to seek answers, become informed, talk to others and try new things, in order to find strategies that suited their family dynamics.
""We acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing diabetes,"" she said.
""Every family is different. The concept that diabetes fits in around you, rather than you fitting in around diabetes, can be a fundamental paradigm shift for a lot of people. The family centre is here to give people the confidence to work with their approach to diabetes in that way.""
With a kitchen on the Stirling premises, cooking sessions for adults and teens allow hands-on training in preparing nutritious meals - an essential skill for type 1 management.
The programs are intended for every member of the family, not just the child with type 1.
Ms Johnson said peer support was another important facet of the centre.
""To be able to connect in with other people who've walked a mile in your shoes is a transformative thing,"" she said.
""People with type 1 and the type 1 community have an incredible knowledge base.""
A monthly Solutions Forum will enable people to share their experiences and learn from others.
The first session, next month, will focus on advice about sports and exercise. This will be followed by forums on how to adapt when a child moves into high school, handling exams and stress, the issues faced as the diabetic enters young adulthood and holiday eating in time for Christmas.
People can also access an online discussion forum and a toolkit of resources, plus visitors can browse a collection of books in the library.
Regular support groups at the centre will allow parents to get together and discuss their issues and concerns. The Newly Diagnosed Support Group, for example, is aimed at parents who have a recently diagnosed child and may be feeling overwhelmed.
The centre will also run social events to encourage families to get together in a fun and casual setting. These include camps and school-holiday activities, such as next week's outing to the Winterland ice-skating rink.
In its advocacy role, the centre can provide people to give talks to community groups to raise awareness of type 1 diabetes.

Sitting ducks for illness Law change needed to get us moving
THE law must be changed to make it illegal for workers to sit for more than two hours at a time, said a leading health expert alarmed at rising diabetes rates.
Professor Jonathan Shaw, whose 12-year ""AusDiab"" study on the health status of 11,000 Australians calculates that 269 adults develop diabetes every day, said drastic measures are needed.
""We need changes to occupational health and safety regulations so it is not allowed for people to sit for two hours at a time without a break,"" he said.
""I think everything should be on the table - taxation levers, town planning, even the layout of office spaces needs to be reconsidered to tackle the growing personal and community impact of chronic disease.""
Prof Shaw from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute said his study had found young people aged 25-34 are gaining more weight than any other age group.
The study also found people overestimated the amount of exercise they thought they were doing by 50 per cent.
People self-reported they spent 200 minutes a day sitting but an electronic device recorded they spent an average 500 minutes a day sitting.
The incidence of diabetes is five times higher in obese people and two times higher in those who are overweight.
Over the 12-year study the average gain in waist circumference among participants was 5.3cm and it was greater in women than in men.
""The trend for greater weight gain among people aged 25-34 is very concerning and suggests Australia still does not recognise the serious health risks associated with being overweight or obese,"" said Prof Shaw. ""The health and wellbeing of a whole generation... is being compromised by a lifestyle rich in energy-dense foods and low on physical activity.""
The study also found the prevalence of depression was 65 per cent higher in people with diabetes and they showed double the rate of cognitive impairment than those without diabetes.
Living in the most disadvantaged areas doubled the risk of developing diabetes, the study found.
The community needed to get serious about weight gain in the same way it got serious about smoking and gun control and water restrictions, Prof Shaw said.
He also advocated a tax on junk food, subsidies for healthy foods, standing desks in workplaces and stairs more accessible to encourage more physical activity.
A rule banning sitting for more than two hours might not go down well with employers but they should ""look on it as a long-term investment in their employees"".

Parents 'failed' dying daughter
RICHARD Edward knew his diabetic daughter was ill, but was convinced the teenager had only been struck with a bout of gastroenteritis.
He resolved to treat Dawn, 14, on his own by giving her lemonade to drink and ice blocks to eat - but never made the one phone call that would have saved her life.
Yesterday he and Dawn's mother wept as the Supreme Court was told their failure to call a doctor amounted to neglect so severe that they deserved 15-year jail terms.
Richard Edward, 49, and Debra Edward, 52, pleaded guilty to one count each of causing their daughter's death by criminal neglect.
Dawn, who was a triplet and one of the couple's five children, died in her family's Hackham West home on August 9, 2009.
Carmen Matteo, prosecuting, said Dawn had type one diabetes and was insulin dependent.
""She died of hyperglycaemia, or high blood glucose levels, and dehydration,"" she said.
""The prosecution case is that each of the defendants failed to obtain medical assistance for Dawn in the week before her death, when she was obviously sick.""
She said that, by their pleas, the couple had admitted their failure was ""a gross departure"" from the standard of care expected of parents.
Ms Matteo said the former couple had varying degrees of intellectual disability, as did their children, past contact with Families SA, and had been taught the ""danger signs"" of diabetes.
Justin Wickens, for Richard Edward, said his client ""wrote off"" Dawn's suffering as a bout of gastroenteritis.
""He hoped that the situation would resolve itself, and that hope was ill-founded,"" he said.
Justice Kevin Nicholson said he had a difficult task ahead of him.
He will hear further submissions on Wednesday.

Nurse honoured for work with diabetes sufferers
Dianne Roberts will always have fond memories of the little patient who gave her a pair of fairy wings, telling her she was a fairy godmother. The senior ACT Health Diabetes Service nurse knows how hard it can be for children and their families when they receive a diagnosis of type1 diabetes, and she also knows that educating them about the illness and how to manage it properly can mean the world of difference. Although she doesn't think of herself as a fairy godmother, she says the greatest joy of her work is helping patients. ""I really admire how children and their families cope,"" she said. ""It's a lovely thing to witness these families and the children grow and become capable young people who take good care of their diabetes. I guess the role of an educator is to give the family and the child the skills and knowledge to self-manage their diabetes."" Ms Roberts' sensitive counselling saw her win the Impact and Relationships Award at the 2013 JDRF Diabetes Educator Awards on the weekend. Ms Roberts, who works at Centenary Hospital for Women and Children for ACT Health's Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Service, said it was ""kind of"" embarrassing to be recognised for her work. ""I am just one of many people and we've got lots of dedicated, lovely and passionate health professionals. It's lovely being recognised but I shouldn't be singled out because I work with a fabulous group of people,"" she said.
""Our families are just inspirational. I get inspired by what they do to take care of their kids. They do all this work that I think is under- recognised."" Chief Minister and Health Minister Katy Gallagher congratulated Ms Roberts on her award. ""Type 1 diabetes is a daunting condition for anyone, but it's especially confronting to children, and Dianne plays a crucial role in helping Canberra children adjust to living with this condition and minimising the impact to their day- to-day lives,"" Ms Gallagher said. ""It is testament to Dianne's character that the prizemoney for this award will be put back into the hospital to fund new education technologies that will be targeted to young people who develop type 1 diabetes, as well as research projects attached to diabetes education."" ACT Health Diabetes Service director Chris Nolan said Ms Roberts had contributed enormously to children and adolescents throughout the ACT and NSW over many years. ""This award by JDRF recognises her devotion to the care of young people and their families affected by diabetes, as well as support to the schools and teachers of these young people,"" he said. Ms Roberts estimates that she has helped about 600 children and their families during her career. ""We teach them about how to treat highs and lows, how to adjust their insulin for sport and exercise and just cope with day-to-day activities,"" she said. ""Diabetes affects every aspect of a child's life so you need education around all those things. ""As much as I can, I try to help families and children get on with their lives. Diabetes is just a component and I try to fit the diabetes into their life, not their life into diabetes,"" she said. JDRF Australia chief executive Mike Wilson said type 1 diabetes was a serious and difficult disease, but thanks to the efforts of diabetes educators such as Ms Roberts and the other award winners, people could lead full and active lives. There were more than 170 nominations for this year's JDRF awards, with Gael Holters from the Bankstown-Lidcombe Diabetes Centre winning the excellence and innovation award for introducing a type 1 diabetes service for young adults. Port Augusta Hospital's Michelle Kuerschner was the winner of the People's Choice Award.

Monthly jab may keep diabetics' blood healthy
AUSTRALIAN researchers have discovered the mechanism that leads to excessive platelets being produced in the blood of diabetics, which puts them at increased risk of stroke and heart attack.
The finding has led them to identify two promising treatments, fuelling hope that a monthly injection could soon be offered to the 1.7 million Australians with type 1 or 2 diabetes to safeguard the health of their blood vessels.
Platelets, the blood cells in plasma, help stop bleeding through clotting but too many can lead to blood clots that cause heart attack and stroke.
And while aspirin is a proven blood thinner, it is less effective in those with diabetes because the platelets become resistant.
Researchers, led by the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, showed that in mice, high blood glucose causes an increased platelet production, and the resulting cardiovascular disease seen in 70 per cent of diabetics.
Lead researcher Associate Professor Andrew Murphy said they used a new type of glucose-lowering drug to control platelets levels. Further, they found the specific protein that caused this increased platelet supply in response to high blood glucose.

Surge in type two diabetes alarms health funds
Hospitals faced a surge of type two diabetes patients over the past three years, alarming health insurance companies about their growing medical bills. Medibank chief medical officer Linda Swan said the figures sent a signal to the health fund that it needed to staunch the spiralling cost of type two diabetes. ""We've been hearing about the epidemic of diabetes for years, but it's not until you see the stark reality that you see this is growing at an extraordinary rate and clearly we're not doing enough,"" Dr Swan said. Most type two diabetes hospital presentations were avoidable, but the quandary was how to prevent them in the most efficient way. ""We're seeing in Australia an ageing population and an increasing number of people with chronic disease and obviously that's driving the cost of health care, but what we're hearing from our members is they don't want to pay more for health care. That's the challenge our industry faces."" Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said the disease threatened to overwhelm the viability of the national health system, with 4400 amputations performed in hospitals each year and 10,000 admissions due to ulcers and foot sores, many of them preventable. ""Diabetes is a very significant driver of hospitalisations when you look at all of the complications,"" Professor Johnson said. ""I think health insurers are very worried because they're substantial funders of the hospitals. People with diabetes are potentially big costs to them and they're starting to wake up to that and do programs that keep people healthy."" Insurers cannot charge people different premiums based on their health status and they cannot refuse to insure any individual. The Primary Health Care Advisory group recommended last year that private insurers be encouraged to fund the prevention and management of chronic conditions, possibly through the risk equalisation pool that is used to compensate health funds with the sickest patients.

See the light
APPLE 'S next big thing could be great news for the 1.75 million Australians with diabetes, and medical experts say it could revolutionise management of their chronic illness.
CEO Tim Cook started the rumours when he recently announced he was wearing a prototype device that could measure his blood-sugar level without the need for the invasive finger prick, and the company hired bioengineers with expertise in the area.
It might take years before Apple is ready to bring the device to market - or it could unveil it as early as Tuesday at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose.
Little is known about the device but it is likely to use optical sensors to shine a light through the skin to measure glucose.
Apple is not the only player in this field.
Three years ago Google unveiled a prototype contact lens that could test for sugar levels although Google has not yet brought a product to market.
And Brisbane-based medical firm Glucotek Inc recently lodged a patent for smart ear rings that work as non-invasive blood-glucose monitors.
The company is finalising a prototype and last month was named the winner of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology entrepreneurial boot camp involving 30 countries.
Diabetes Australia consumer manager Renza Scibilia, who has type 1 diabetes, warns that while any advancement is welcome, there are reasons to be cautious.
Ms Scibilia said unless any device was approved as having an accuracy level suitable for a medical device, it would be considered as more in line with an activity tracker that provided health trend data.

Latitude a risk factor
Researchers worldwide have long suspected that latitude is an important predictor of childhood type 1 diabetes but a new study from Perth's Telethon Kids Institute has strengthened the case that you are at a higher risk the farther you live from the equator.
After teasing out data between 1991 and 2010, researchers found the rate was twice as high in the south of WA than in the north. Significantly, it also showed the influence of latitudinal gradient was independent of other possible risk factors - the obvious ones being socioeconomic status, population density, remoteness and ethnicity.
A possible explanation for the results is that people who live further from the equator may have reduced skin exposure to sunlight, or different exposure to other environmental factors such as infections, according to diabetes clinician and Telethon Kids researcher Elizabeth Davis.
""These people may miss out on some of the health benefits of safe levels of ultraviolet radiation, such as the production of vitamin D,"" Dr Davis said.
""High levels of vitamin D deficiency in the Australian population suggest this might be a factor.""
She said other autoimmune conditions had been linked to latitude as well, including multiple sclerosis.
Because the WA Department of Health supported data linkage in WA, researchers were able to build a good picture of what influenced diabetes. The next step is to look at the whole of Australia to find out whether the same pattern exists.
""We already know diabetes is over-represented in metropolitan versus rural areas,"" said Dr Davis, adding it was also more common depending on which country you lived in, with Sardinia and Finland having the highest incidences in the world.
""Within Australia, if you live in high urban density you have a higher risk than if you live in low density and we have previously shown that if you are in a higher socio-economic group you have a higher risk of your child having type 1 diabetes than if you are in a low socio-economic group.
""The onset of diabetes also has a cyclical pattern - a five-year cyclical pattern - which is very interesting.""
She said exposure to infections such as the enterovirus had also been implicated when examining triggers for type 1 diabetes and it could be that infections in regions close to the equator were different to those further from it.
""When we looked at all the kids who were diagnosed over a long period of time and found those living in an area furthest from the equator had a higher risk of getting diabetes, it added another piece to the puzzle,"" Dr Davis said.
""But I wouldn't want anybody moving house or moving somewhere else to reduce the risk because that would be oversimplifying things.""
She said by better understanding these patterns, scientists hoped to reduce the cases of type 1 diabetes which was a growing health problem worldwide. Despite big advances in treatment, the condition remained a serious one, with a long-term trend of 2-3 per cent increased incidence each year throughout the world.
Type 1 diabetes is caused by the body's own immune system attacking and destroying insulin-making beta cells and is distinct from the much more common type 2 version of the disease, which is mainly linked to obesity and lifestyle and typically seen in adults.

Device takes pain out of daily glucose checks for diabetics 
An innovative glucose-monitoring device, which removes the need for multiple daily finger pricks, could be rolled out to hundreds of thousands of Australians with diabetes if the federal government agrees to fund it.
The device, FreeStyle Libre, is expensive to use full-time for many people, given it costs $92.50 every 14 days for discs used to monitor glucose levels. That equates to about $2500 annually, including the cost of the reader.
Elizabeth McKinley, 58, a single mother of five, who has had type 2 diabetes for 15 years, has called for the costs to be reimbursed. She has trialled the device and found it significantly helped in managing her diabetes, but the ongoing cost meant she had to stop using it.
""I have been a single mum of five kids for 23 years and my chemist bill has always been astronomical at almost $300 a month, so I can't justify another $50 a week, as that is my petrol to and from work. I really need it to be reimbursed,"" she said.
""It is a big part of your life, testing your sugars and trying to manage that. I watched my father lose both his legs and I lost a sister, both to diabetes."" The system reads glucose levels through a sensor worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days and eliminates the need for routine finger pricks.
Abbott, the company behind the device, is working with the federal Health Department to seek reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre through the National Diabetes Services Scheme. Peter Chalikias, regional director of diabetes care for Abbott's Australian and New Zealand arm, said the device, which can be used by children as young as four, has been available in Australia for just over a year.
""Australia was one of the first countries to get it because there was a great unmet need here to help people control their glucose levels,"" he said.
""Our ultimate goal to is ensure everyone has affordable access to the device. There is a vast majority of people with diabetes for whom the cost is prohibitive."" The Health Department said it was undertaking a cost-effectiveness evaluation of the FreeStyle Libre product to determine its suitability for inclusion on the NDSS.
""This process involves an assessment by an advisory committee, including clinical experts and consumer representatives, as well as a public consultation process, which concluded in August 2017,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The evaluation is expected to be completed by the end of this year.""

Older women on statins face diabetes risk
Older Australian women who take statins to control their cholesterol have a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes type 2.
A new Queensland study shows they have a 33 per cent to 50 per cent increased chance of developing diabetes, depending on the dose.
The authors say the ""dose effect"" is most concerning and these women should not be exposed to high doses.
Statins have been in wide use for more than 25 years, but in 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration advised their use may increase the risk of diabetes type 2.
Most clinical studies have shown that, on average, statins increase the risk of diabetes by 10 per cent.
This 10-year study of older women is surprising because it found their risk was so much higher. Also surprising was the extent to which older women are prescribed these drugs.
At the beginning of the study, none of the 8400 women had diabetes and some were taking statins. By the end, half had taken statins and 5 per cent had diabetes.
Lead author Dr Mark Jones, of the University of Queensland's School of Public Health, says during the study most of the women progressed to higher doses.
He suggests older women on these popular drugs should be regularly monitored for increased blood glucose to ensure early detection and appropriate management of diabetes.
While the increase in risk seems high and is a worry, it is a relative risk, not an absolute risk.
After 10 years, almost 6 per cent of women on statins had diabetes, while less than 5 per cent of those not on the drug had it, too.
""The difference may not sound like much, but at their stage of life the last thing we want to do is to introduce another disease to 1 per cent of this population,"" says the second author, Emeritus Professor Sue Tett. ""By introducing another disease, we will introduce more drugs, more risks of side effects, plus the effects of this disease on the eyes and the kidneys, and other aspects of health.""
Professor Tett, of the School of Pharmacy at UQ, was surprised that half the women ended up on statins.
While statins help prevent a second cardiovascular event, the evidence they help prevent a first event is scant. She says it's unlikely half of these older women had already had such an event.
In some cases she said de-prescription would probably be appropriate, but as there is a reluctance to do that, she suggests reducing the dose to the effective minimum.
She says the minimum dose of statins generally gives the most powerful effect and anything after that provides marginal benefits.
The new study, published in the journal Drugs and Ageing, drew its data from women who were regularly surveyed as part of the Women's Health Australia study. It shows that in their late 70s and 80s, about 50 per cent of women were on statins.
""Statins are highly prescribed in this age group, but there are very few clinical trials looking at their effects on older women,"" Dr Jones said. ""The vast majority of research is on 40- to 70-year-old men.""
The study shows women over 75 on statins faced an average increased risk of 33 per cent of developing diabetes.
Dr Jones says the result may be explained by the fact that women are more likely to develop diabetes and that age is a risk factor.
He was particularly interested in statins because both his parents stopped taking them in their 70s because of side effects such as muscle and memory issues.

Weight loss a winning bonus
Mandurah retiree Keith Spice is already reaping the rewards of signing up for the ground-breaking Testosterone for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Men at High Risk trial (T4DM).
The first in WA to volunteer, Mr Spice, 63, has lost 30kg in just over a year. He had been told he was pre-diabetic in 2005 but had not done anything about it until he saw a call for people to volunteer for the study.
""I thought this could be a win-win, it could help medical research but it could help me. It will give me motivation and the incentive to at least lose weight and that has got to be a good thing,"" he said.
Mr Spice said he had not noticed any major changes other than his dramatic weight loss, which he attributed to the free weight-loss program that is part of the trial.
""That diet is phenomenal because they don't say 'you can't eat this and you can't eat that', I wouldn't have joined it (if that was the case), it is just the serve sizes. I can eat everything I like, it is just the portions.""

High-tech help for diabetics
About 24,000 Canberrans have diabetes, and numbers are set to soar this decade. But those in the nation's capital are embracing a range of modern technologies taking a little of the pain out of managing the chronic disease. The ACT already has the highest rate of insulin pumps in Australia, with 15per cent of those living with known type 1 diabetes using one, and ACT Health Diabetes Service director Chris Nolan said a smart meter for calculating insulin doses was becoming more popular. ""They have been coming into the market in the last 18 months - they're not that common [in the ACT] at the moment but we certainly have more patients going on them. ""Numbers are probably going to double in the next year or so."" Liam Shanahan, 26, has used the smart meter since last year and said it was a valuable tool, particularly for those with constantly changing food choices or eating times. He said the blood glucose meter did similar computing to the pump - which can cost $9500 and delivers a low dose of insulin throughout the day, adjusted at meal times - for those who self-administer, and had led to increased productivity. ""You can be thirsty, tired, lethargic when [your glucose levels are] high, [and] sweaty, shaky, dizzy when it's low,"" he said. ""Previously in terms of the low, it might happen two or three times a week - it might happen infrequently now, might be once a week that it's low. ""You are more productive - if you're not feeling too crash hot you can't work well."" Dr Nolan said the Diabetes Service staff provided education on the meter's use. The Canberra Hospital-based director said patients' lives would also be improved by a new data sharing service known as Diasend, which allows individual readings to be uploaded via the web to the cloud, for remote diagnosis and advice by doctors and other health professionals. ""We've been developing it over about the last six months,"" he said. ""It's well set up in the paediatric service, and we're starting to set it up in the Diabetes Service - we're setting it up at the Gungahlin Community Health Centre."" Diabetes Service senior nursing clinician Di Roberts said there were also a number of free carbohydrate-counting apps to help patients make their four or five daily calculations. ""Diabetes and technology marry well, probably because there's so many numbers involved,"" she said. The ACT Chief Health Officer's latest report described projections for a 50per cent increase in diabetes incidence by 2020. National Diabetes Week ends on Saturday.

Health wrap diabetes Tori
Heathridge student Tori Brown is having to juggle all the responsibilities of her final year at school with the extra stress of dealing with type 1 diabetes.
With plans to go to university next year, the 17-year-old knows it is essential for her to manage her health as she keeps busy with study, a part-time job and learning to drive.
Tori was five when her mother took her to the doctors suspecting she might be diabetic.
""That was the day our world changed,"" Peta Brown said. ""We went through a hard and fast training process at PMH on how to keep her alive.
""This was it for the rest of her life - needles, force feeding, restricting eating, finger pricks, carb counting, weighing food and sleep deprivation.
""I'll never forget the day that we came home; Tori thought the needles and finger pricks would stop - it's hard to explain to a five-year-old it won't stop, this is your life.
""In the early days, I had to hold her screaming while I pulled out her tiny fingers from her tight fist to do the six to eight finger pricks a day. I cried each time.
""That grieving process is not just at diagnosis, as a parent you grieve different things at different times - the days she's shattered because she has been up through the night dealing with hypos; the day she realised she can't go into the defence force.""
It took Tori a while to accept that monitoring her blood-sugar and insulin levels was a daily routine for life.
""Knowing that there's no other way, it's really the choice of daily needles or death, to be honest,"" Tori said.
""I have days where I envy people around me but I remind myself that it could be worse and that I should just get on and enjoy my life and not dwell on what could have been.""
Tori said being on an insulin pump for the past 10 years has given her more freedom and allowed her to lead a more normal life.
""Even though it is a machine attached to me 24/7, it has become a part of me,"" she said.
""It's my life support and I would never go back to needles. I guess because I was so young when I got the pump, I don't know what life would be like without it by my side.""
Tori said her biggest challenge was educating others about the condition, with many confusing it with type 2 diabetes. ""This has been the most frustrating thing - 'Did you eat too much sugar'... 'Did you just not exercise enough'... I've heard it all.""
Tori hoped the new Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre would give the community more knowledge and understanding. She also hoped it would enable her to connect with others like herself.
""I have recently opened up on social media much more which has allowed me to connect with diabetics around the world,"" she said.
""I believe that the centre will allow me to meet type 1 diabetics who can help me and who I can help.
""I want anybody who is newly diagnosed as well as others to come together as a big family. I hope it will become a place where people will want to go to meet up with friends and get help if they need it.""
Tori has been involved in focus groups about what the family centre should provide to type 1 families.
One of her top priorities is support for teens as they make the transition to adult life and become more independent.

Event shows diabetic kids they're not alone
As the fog parted and the sun shone on the nation's capital, children took to the ice at Skate in the City for a session of frolicking and fun on Saturday afternoon. Families of children with type1 diabetes gathered as part of the Jelly Bean Picnic on Ice, making the most of the change in weather. Diabetes ACT chief executive officer Gil Cremer said the event aimed to help families realise they were not alone. Ms Cremer said while the ACT hadn't hosted a meet-and-greet event for a few years, she planned to make it an annual priority. ""There are about 260 children in the ACT under 18 with type1 diabetes,"" she said. ""It's one of the most common diseases in childhood. ""The event is to give them a chance to see other children with type1 diabetes, and so they realise they can do what other kids can do."" Ms Cremer said the ice skating activity also provided a welcome distraction from the daily grind of incurable genetic disease. ""Most children have at least four to five injections of insulin each day, or they're on the continuous insulin pump,"" she said.
""They also have to monitor their blood glucose levels, so they prick their finger and check that, some of them up to 10 times a day. For eight-year-old diabetes sufferer Brianna Blackmore, the event provided a chance to spend time with her three siblings, Taliah, 10, Makayla, six, and Kaiden, five. Their mum, Anne Blackmore, said it was the first event of its kind they had been able to attend, as they were usually held in Sydney. ""It's a great opportunity to meet other families who are I the same position as we are."" Mrs Blackmore said it helped Brianna realise there was a lot of support for her and others in a similar position. ""I think it's quite important for her to know there are other people out there experiencing the same as her.""

An eye scan developed by the CSIRO allows GPs to screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, a debilitating condition that affects one in three of the 1.7 million Australians with diabetes and which can lead to blindness.
Currently, only specialists can test for the condition, but eye-screening technology has been successfully tested by Perth GPs. The technology's creator and trial co-lead, Yogi Kanagasingam, said the innovation could help people with diabetic retinopathy get treatment faster.
""Patients at risk of this condition would usually be referred to a specialist for screening, waiting six weeks or more,"" he said. ""Now it can potentially be done in a single 30-minute visit to a GP.""
The trial, at the GP Superclinic at Midland Railway Workshops, was funded with a National Health and Medical Research Council grant and money from the WA Health Department and CSIRO.
During the trial, GPs screened 187 diabetic patients, taking high-resolution images of their eyes, which were then analysed by the technology for signs of diabetic retinopathy.
The images were also analysed by an ophthalmologist, and the technology was found to be as effective as the specialist in detecting signs of diabetic retinopathy and grading its severity.
""Early detection and intervention for diabetic retinopathy is key, and this new tool is the first step to help GPs prioritise patients for treatment,"" Professor Kanagasingam said.

Potato diet raises diabetes risk for pregnant women
Amanda Donney knows what diabetes looks like. Her father had it and she's worried her children might be at risk of the disease.
Now pregnant with her first child, she is aware of the risks of eating too many starchy foods. ""There's a lot on what you shouldn't be eating. The doctors tell you 'don't eat this, don't eat that',"" she said.
But new research published this week in the British Medical Journal has found that women who eat more than five servings of potato a week before becoming pregnant are more likely to develop gestational diabetes while carrying the baby.
The research, conducted over 10 years and with thousands of test subjects, concluded that even diets of seemingly innocuous foods such as french fries or potato mash are associated with increased risk for pregnant women.
""As far as diet, I've tried to fix a diet by eating healthy but I've sort of let myself go a bit,"" Ms Donney said.
""I've tried to stay away from all the foods they tell me not to eat. They say not to eat ham and sushi - I haven't gone anywhere near sushi.""
But she isn't alone. With the wealth of dietary information out there, sometimes choosing the right things to eat before and during pregnancy can be tricky, especially if it requires special ingredients.
""I try to look at how many certain foods I should be having each day, and how much protein and how much carbs and all that,"" she said.
But according to Professor Linda Tapsell, of the University of Wollongong, women like Ms Donney have no reason to be alarmed by the research. Even though potatoes are singled out in the study, the link between potato consumption and gestational diabetes is not causal.
""It's very important to note that potatoes don't cause diabetes,"" she said. ""While [the study] might come across as a negative story on potatoes, in my mind it's really supporting the moderation component.
""There are a lot of foods women need to be vigilant about. They need to be eating nutritious foods and vegetables. We've been saying moderation and balance all along, and particularly in the area of diabetes.""
The humble potato is one of the world's most popular food crops, with many Australians consuming them in one form or another as part of their normal diets.
With regular meals including a side of potato mash or hot chips with fish, Ms Donney is no different. But she is likely to make different decisions about her family's diet.
""It's an easier option with potatoes because they're easy, they're ready to go,"" she said. ""But I do worry for our children because they're going to be at much higher risk.""
Professor Tapsell says the key is eating a variety of vegetables.
""For me, it doesn't tell me that potatoes are bad, it just tells me when we're thinking of vegetables, we're not thinking of just potatoes. They're suggesting whole grains and legumes as well, and that's moving into things like quinoa, lentils and chickpeas. [The study] is there to put evidence behind that message of moderation and balance.""

Type 1 sufferers living longer
AUSTRALIANS living with type 1 diabetes have a significantly improved life expectancy, despite an almost doubling in the incidence of the disease in the past 20 years, research out today will show.
Research to be published in the Medical Journal of Australia shows recent advances in the effective management of type 1 diabetes are helping sufferers to live a longer and healthier life.
Researcher Professor Peter Colman, Dr Mervyn Kyi and a team of endocrinologists at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, found the incidence of type 1 diabetes had doubled over the past 20 years and the disease is still associated with considerable premature mortality.
However, they said ""recent findings show that a significant improvement in life expectancy has occurred"".
People living with type 1 diabetes generally live shorter lives, with life expectancy generally being reduced by more than 20 years. Professor Colman said the research team would now be shifting their focus from treatment to prevention.

Diabetic teens to lose clinic
Senior doctors at Princess Margaret Hospital believe a move to scrap the adolescent diabetes clinic at the new children's hospital is a backward step that could put teenagers' lives at risk.
A diabetes specialist, who asked not to be named, said that while there were separate areas at PMH for young children and teenagers with diabetes, that approach was being abandoned at the new hospital due to open in Nedlands in 2015.
""We have a diabetes service at the new hospital but they don't have a separate clinic where we can look after adolescents and we think that's a backward step,"" the doctor said. ""Teenagers don't want to sit in a room full of toys and little posters up on the walls. It's a time when you're trying to help them grow up and transition, so it's a very critical, vulnerable age group and we're quite concerned about this.""
The doctors were critical of hospital planners for not including a separate adolescent clinic, warning that if teenagers did not feel comfortable seeking medical help they were less likely to get the advice they needed to manage their diabetes safely.
This could mean not checking their blood sugars and taking insulin.
Diabetes WA echoed their concerns, saying there was good evidence that services geared up for a five-year-old were not suitable for a 15-year-old.
More than 1000 people in WA under the age of 18 have diabetes, half of them teenagers, and the condition is twice as common as 20 years ago.
""We would like to see the very different needs of children and adolescents with diabetes taken into consideration when planning any related facility,"" a spokesman said. ""For adolescents, the psycho-social aspect of living with diabetes is of major importance and this is different to the services needed by very young children.""
Child and Adolescent Health Service chief executive Philip Aylward said the new hospital's outpatient section had clinics that could be scheduled for specific age groups.
""Moving to the new children's hospital and co-locating with Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital will also allow greater opportunity for improved transition into adult care,"" he said.

This sucks - ATM swallows sick woman's cash
A GREEDY cash machine has left a Darwin woman out of pocket and unable to get to hospital for her regular diabetes treatment.
Shirley Hart, 68, has been laid up in her Wulagi home since the early hours of Thursday morning, when she says a Cashcard ATM at Skycity Darwin spat out her money for the taxi ride home - only to suck it back up seconds later.
It was last money in her account and she had to call her brother who worked an early shift, to pick her up.
She has since heard it was not the first time someone had run foul of the Cashcard brand and wanted to warn others.
""Everyone should know about them,"" Ms Hart said. ""You might go out and get pissed one night and not be able to get home.""
Ms Hart said there was no warning sign on the machine that it would eat the money and her attempts to recover the dough through Cashcard had met dead ends.
She said she had been without money ever since, meaning she could not get to hospital to have treatment on her infected leg, a complication of diabetes.
A Cashcard spokesperson said the ""note retraction feature"" was designed to protect customers who accidentally walked away without taking their cash. ""If the notes are not taken within 30 seconds, the ATM will retract the cash and immediately send a reversal message to the cardholder's financial institution advising that the cash was not taken,"" the spokesperson said.
""The cardholder's financial institution will resolve the issue, acting in accordance with the EFT Code of Conduct and Australian Payments guidelines.""

Diabetic boy died after 'self healing'
A Chinese ""slapping therapist"" charged with the manslaughter of a six-year-old diabetic boy has been denied bail at Sydney's Central Local Court after the magistrate ruled the accused posed a ""significant threat to the community"".
Hong Chi Xiao, 54, who was extradited from London and arrested at Sydney Airport yesterday, is accused of contributing to the child's death after the boy attended one of Mr Xiao's ""self-healing"" seminars with his parents two years ago.
Mr Xiao allegedly advised the type-1 diabetic's parents to stop administering his insulin and cease checking his blood-sugar levels during the $1800-a-week conference at Tasly Healthpac medical clinic at Hurstville.
The court heard the boy's health deteriorated significantly over the course of the seminar and he became unable to walk.
""CCTV footage shows he was physically unwell and was required to be pushed in a stroller,"" police prosecutor Fiona Rowbotham said.
When the boy began vomiting a black substance, Mr Xiao allegedly told the child's parents this was part of the ""detoxification"" process.
Ambulance paramedics were eventually called to a nearby hotel room, where they attempted CPR but the six-year-old could not be revived. He died of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Court papers allege Mr Xiao ""did feloniously slay"" the boy on the night of April 27, 2015.
Mr Xiao, a trained accountant, follows an alternative medicine technique known as PaidaLajin, which promotes ""self-healing"" practices of stretching, fasting and slapping patients until they bruise.
In various YouTube videos and blog posts, the Chinese national and American citizen said the technique could treat diseases such as diabetes.
""This is purely an accident,"" Mr Xiao said of the death in a video released last year. ""This has nothing to do with the workshop. This boy had a lot of diseases, more than we ever know."" Ms Rowbotham told the court that Mr Xiao left Australia on a US passport in 2015, just two days after the boy's death. Mr Xiao's defence told the court that the accused was ""unaware there was a warrant in existence"".
The boy's 56-year-old father, 41-year-old mother and 64-year-old grandmother are also charged with manslaughter. They have been granted conditional bail. Mr Xiao's bail was formally refused by magistrate Les Mabbutt. He will return to court on October 24.

Low-carb diet wins support
A DIABETES organisation has backed a low-carb diet for type 2 diabetes as Tasmanian surgeon Gary Fettke prepares to face professional scrutiny for promoting it.
The Launceston medico will front the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency medical board after a two-year investigation and a ban from giving nutritional advice to his patients.
Dr Fettke, who advocates a low-carb healthy-fat diet to combat diabetes and ill health, says that as an orthopaedic surgeon he is often called upon to	 deal with the complications relating to diabetes and obesity.
His position appears to be supported by the Diabetes NSW/ACT website, which says people on a low-carb diet show ""greater reductions in their diabetes medication requirements, greater improvements in their blood lipid profile and better blood glucose stability.
""This CSIRO study provides great evidence that intensive interventions result in real benefits for people with diabetes, and hopefully demonstrates the need to governments for funding for such interventions on a larger scale,"" the site says.
Former cricketer, politician and journalist Tony Benneworth, who followed Dr Fettke's advice, said he had been able stop all his diabetes medications.
Mr Benneworth said his weight had dropped from 125kg to 110kg and his blood glucose readings were normal. ""Fettke's a good bloke and he's on the right track,"" he said.

Important to note change to ordering of diabetes products
DIABETES is a common medical condition affecting a vast number of people in the community.
As a result, it's vital to understand recent changes to the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS).
Since July 1, all NDSS products (including needles, syringes, blood glucose test strips, urine test strips and insulin pump consumables) have been available from community pharmacies.
These important products can no longer be ordered from Diabetes Australia, state and territory diabetes organisations, in person, online or by phone.
Therefore, it's vital to talk to your local pharmacist or visit your pharmacy regarding the diabetes products you or a family member uses, and check if they keep them in stock. In some cases, pharmacies may need to order products to ensure continuity of supply.
This is particularly important if a family member with diabetes uses an insulin pump as most pharmacies will need to order these by request.
Another important change is that people with type 2 diabetes, who don't use insulin, will be restricted to six months' supply of blood glucose testing strips.
After six months, a health professional is able to apply for authorisation for further supply if there is a clinical need for blood glucose testing.
Of course, there is no change to the cost of any of the NDSS products. If you have any questions or problems, your local community pharmacy and pharmacist is always happy to help you with information and advice on diabetes and the supply of NDSS products.

Aussies close to beating a killer
AUSTRALIAN researchers have discovered a protein that could help prevent overweight people from developing type two diabetes.
Monash University scientists believe the protein that contributes to insulin resistance in people with fatty livers could be a potential drug target.
Up to a third of Australians are affected by non-alcoholic liver disease, putting them at risk of type two diabetes, stroke and heart attacks.
It is more common in overweight and obese Australians because it is caused by fat building up in the liver cells.
""One of the first things that happens to many people when they become obese is that they get a fatty liver which precedes type two diabetes,"" Monash University Department of Physiology Professor Matthew Watt said.
Insulin resistance occurs when the body does not make adequate insulin or becomes resistant to it and is a precursor to diabetes development.
But it was unclear precisely how insulin resistance developed and whether fatty liver was the culprit.
Researchers at the university's School of Biomedical Sciences studied obese mice and found that their fatty livers secreted a different subset of proteins from normal livers.
Prof Watt said they also found that this set of proteins caused insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
They singled out one of these proteins as being particularly important in insulin resistance in mice.
It is the first time the protein had been shown to lead to insulin resistance. ""We examined one of these proteins in great detail and found it caused insulin resistance in several tissues."" They validated the findings by testing the blood of patients with fatty liver disease and found that they had elevated levels of the proteins.
The amount of the protein correlated with the level of insulin resistance. Prof Watt said it was not a cure for type two diabetes, but if it could be blocked it may improve insulin resistance.
The next step is to work out whether blocking the protein in mice could improve the insulin sensitivity. ""This could reduce the risk of developing type two by reducing insulin resistance,"" Prof Watt said. The research, which was carried out with scientists in the Netherlands, had been submitted for publication in a medical journal.

Diabetes danger
An attitude of denial is putting people at risk from diabetes 
THOUSANDS of people are ignoring warning signs and risk factors for diabetes, putting their health and lives at serious risk.
New research has found almost 40 per cent of people with a family history of serious illness refuse to get tested because they fear hearing the results.
And many don't visit their GP because of inconvenience, cost, or belief they won't get ill.
About 280 Australians develop diabetes every day, or one person every five minutes.
There are about 1.2 million Australians with diagnosed diabetes and, worryingly, an estimated 500,000 who have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.
Also of concern is that, due to their genes, about one in four Australians are at higher risk of developing the disease.
There are also many misconceptions about diabetes, including that you must be overweight to develop the disease.
Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented; it is an auto-immune condition that can occur at any age but is most common in children and young adults.
But type 2 diabetes may be prevented or delayed by exercise and healthy eating. While it most commonly develops in adults over 45, it is being increasingly seen in younger age groups including children and adolescents.
Amcal pharmacist James Nevile said the research was concerning. ""We know lots of people are at risk and a lot of people are diagnosed, and they aren't necessarily engaged in the health system.
""Early symptoms of diabetes can be mild, or there may be no symptoms at all, but in the longer term there can be some pretty serious health conditions and implications from health issues that are easy to ignore early on."" Symptoms of diabetes can include excessive thirst and urination, blurred vision, leg cramps, fatigue, hunger, slow healing wounds, weight change, headaches, dizziness and mood swings.
Mr Nevile said some people who did experience symptoms still failed to investigate the cause with their doctor or pharmacist.
""There are a lot of barriers to actually seeking treatment including availability of appointments and cost,"" he said.
Although people wouldn't necessarily go to see a doctor, Mr Nevile said most still went to pharmacies, even just to get cough and cold medication and deal with other minor health issues.
He said pharmacists had a role to play in helping people to keep on top of their health, through offering screening programs, health questionnaires and tests.
He said a new blood test could help motivate people with diabetes, or those at risk, to actually visit their GP.
A new HBA1C test, a simple finger-prick blood test, could provide an average blood glucose level over the past three months. A result is delivered in minutes. ""We've found that if you give someone a number or something to hang their hat on, it is a good way to motivate them to see their doctor,"" Mr Nevile said.

Symbolism not lost on low-income diabetes sufferers
About 1.7 million Australians suffer from diabetes, but far fewer have access to effective education resources, according to the academic behind Emojifit, a symbols-based health management app.
Timothy Skinner, a diabetes expert and leading force behind Emojifit, says information on diabetes is over-complicated, requiring a ""university-level"" reading ability, while prevention often requires a comprehensive and informed shake-up to the way sufferers live their lives.
Patients often require significant changes to lifestyle including guidance on diet, physical activity and a host of other factors to mitigate the impact of the disease.
Professor Skinner, head of the school of Psychological and Clinical Science at Charles Darwin University, developed Emojifit to distil the wealth of information into a simplified and digestible user experience that helps sufferers improve their lives, regardless of their education.
""We see higher rates of diabetes in low-income, lower-education groups,"" Professor Skinner says.
""A lot of the resources are just not designed for these groups. ""We're trying to make Emojifit low-level, language-free, so it can be accessible by any populations relying on these emoji to help them make informed decisions."" The user interface is extremely simplified - with as many concepts as possible distilled into obvious symbols - a heart represents heart health; a brain, stroke; an under-inflated male gender symbol, erectile dysfunction. There is text throughout the app, though it's simplified and plays second fiddle to the symbols.
Emojifit is a deliberately unusual experience for anybody used to scheduling or productivity apps.
There is no one-tap reminders or automatically generated calendar events, Emojifit demands you slow down and think about the commitments you're making. In the free version of the app, users have access to only a single ""plan"", which allows you to select from a range of emoji-represented concerns, including heart, eye and kidney disease, erectile dysfunction or stroke. In the full version ($2.99), users are given up to four plans.
Your current wellbeing is assessed, and you're asked what area of diabetes-related health you'd like to work on, and how you'd like to tackle it. Simple enough stuff, but once you've chosen your action (say, take cholesterol pills); you're given a basic calendar feature and asked how confident you are that you can follow through.
This is where Emojifit gets weird, and potentially wonderful. Professor Skinner and the app's developers recognise it's easy enough to set a reminder to take pills, but that kickstarting a weight-loss regime with regular exercise is a lot harder. Setting a low confidence number prompts the user with a friendly ""Can you change your plan to feel more confident"" message and kicks back to the previous screen. It's decidedly lo-fi, but in a very human way - the app just wants to make sure you have the best chance of success.
Professor Skinner says it's crucial that people take their diabetes mitigation strategies into their own hands. ""They are choosing the behaviour they want to target,"" he says.
""It's not driven healthcare professionals telling them what to do, we're giving the person tools to help them make choices for themselves, which we know increases the likelihood they're going to do it."" The app is built upon Apple's ResearchKit and Carekit frameworks, which allow for simplified delivery of key health stats to healthcare professionals and researchers.
The sharing capability of Emojifit is relatively limited at this stage, featuring automatic email generation of key stats for healthcare providers.
Emojifit is not without problems, mostly as a byproduct of oversimplification. Simple things, like to-the-minute reminders, or a largely redundant bottom navigation menu create an unintuitive and unpolished experience.
It's disappointing that the app ships without any HealthKit integration, meaning users won't have plans tailored to their live and accurate health stats. HealthKit, another Apple platform, aggregates and shares health information (like heart rate, weight or activity) from various apps and devices, across the iOS ecosystem.
It's only the first version of the app, so expect things to change, but they'll need to if users are to embrace the quirks of the one-step-at-a-time experience.
It's rough around the edges but Emojifit's noble aspirations for a new direction in self-management of disease makes it worthy of a look-in for sufferers of Type 2 diabetes. With further development, this little Aussie app has the potential to improve many lives.

Risks of diabetes largely unknown
Three-quarters of Australians underestimate the prevalence of diabetes, while more than 50 per cent do not associate it with heart attacks or strokes, according to a new Diabetes Australia report. The report, published on Monday, comes at the beginning of national diabetes week and as an ACT company launches an in- home blood test service with results available online. The study found only 40 per cent of Australians knew heart disease was a possible complication, while only 34 per cent associated it with strokes. Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said the report proved Australians had a limited understanding of the disease and more needed to be done. ""This study of over 1000 Australians highlights most people still underestimate the vast number of people developing diabetes and the serious health complications of diabetes if it's not diagnosed and managed,"" ""People also tend to underestimate their personal risk.

Wasted decade on indigenous health, with little improvement
Survey results - Diabetes, asthma, osteoporosis more common
Indigenous health has not improved at all in many areas of Australia over the past decade, data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed.
The largest-ever survey of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health found rates of diabetes, kidney disease, asthma and osteoporosis have increased, and the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous measures has widened for smoking, psychological distress, heart disease and asthma.
It follows research released last week that showed the gap in life expectancy between indigenous and non-indigenous had declined slightly, to about 11 years.
Life expectancy in Aboriginal Australia is on par with countries such as Azerbaijan, Vanuatu and Guatemala.
An indigenous child born today can expect to live 71.4 years, far lower than the expected national average of 82.1 years.
Indigenous smoking rates declined by 10 percentage points since 2002, but more than 40 per cent of indigenous people aged 15 and over are smoking on a daily basis, compared with less than 19 per cent of non-indigenous people.
""There's been a significant decline in smoking in urban areas but it's remained stubbornly high in remote areas... and it's still a very high smoking rate compared to the non-indigenous population. So we still have a very big public health challenge,"" said Paul Jelfs, division head for social, health and labour at the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ""Younger people are quitting or not taking up smoking in much larger numbers. Among 15- to 24-year-olds, 54 per cent have never smoked and 10 per cent are ex-smokers.""
However, the survey showed health results have worsened in other areas.
Indigenous Australians are nearly four times as likely to have kidney disease and three times as likely to have experienced high or very high levels of psychological distress. One in six Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people aged 25 and over have diabetes or high sugar levels, and indigenous Australians are more than three times as likely as non-indigenous Australians to have diabetes.
Chief executive of the Heart Foundation Lyn Roberts said the trend was encouraging ""but when you look at the rates themselves, that's still terribly high"". ""With Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, we're seeing high rates of diabetes, high levels of smoking, and high levels of overweight and obesity, which are all risk factors for heart disease,"" she said.
Citing improvements in smoking levels, Justin Mohamed, chair of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, said the results showed change was possible when indigenous communities were properly ""empowered and resourced"". ""This report should make government realise that things can change... This shows that when we're given control, we can win,"" he said.
Lisa Jackson Pulver, professor of public health and director of Muru Marri indigenous health unit at the University of NSW, said the decline had importance for the indigenous community because those who had quit or never smoked would have probably grown up in households with much higher rates of smoking.
""These are people whose odds, according to all the reports and everything we know, were that they were going to smoke too... Now the hard-core stats are showing that doesn't have to be you,"" she said.
""This is something very important for Aboriginal people, who so often get told because you're in that environment, this is what's going to happen.""

Diabetes linked to mental health
Perth researchers want young people with type 1 diabetes screened for mental health problems, after finding they are twice as likely to be affected as other teens.

One of 27,000 diagnosed cases across the state, the Diabetes Tasmania volunteer said since 1980 he had a committed focus on regular exercise, a good diet and a moderate intake of alcohol.
But while Mr Tesefaldet has his symptoms under control, the 280 Australians developing diabetes every day and more than 10,000 Tasmanians living with the disease undiagnosed are the target during National Diabetes Week.

""Australians underestimate their risk of developing diabetes and do not perceive diabetes as a serious condition,"" Ms Wells said.
""There are serious complications common to all types of diabetes including heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, limb amputation, depression, anxiety and blindness. With careful management people can live well with their condition.
""Throughout National Diabetes Week 2015, we are calling on all Tasmanians to find out what they need to know about diabetes."" Ms Wells recommended people talk to their GP about their level of risk, or pick up a risk-assessment brochure from Diabetes Tasmania.

Keeping an eye on the future for diabetics 
NATHAN EFRON AC
When Nathan Efron decided to pursue a career in eye research, he didn't know his work would save people's feet.
Professor Efron, who today claims Australia's second-highest honour, being named a Companion of the Order of Australia, has devoted his life to sight problems. Now he is using the eye to diagnose a very different type of medical issue - nerve damage triggered by diabetes.
The Queensland University of Technology optometrist has pioneered an eye test that detects diabetic neuropathy, which causes excruciating pain in the arms and legs. But an even more perilous symptom in Professor Efron's home state of Queensland is the numbness it can induce in the soles of the feet. ""The major cause of amputations is diabetic neuropathy-related foot ulcers,"" he said. ""People go out walking on the footpath on a hot day, or stand on a nail, and can't feel it. They develop ulcers on their feet (which) become gangrenous."" While the condition has no treatment, the test can warn people they have it years before symptoms emerge. Professor Efron discovered that the rate of nerve degeneration in the arms and legs was precisely mirrored in the fine nerve fibres of the cornea.
A diabetic himself, Professor Efron developed the test with his doctor, who turned out to be a world authority on diabetic neuropathy. The method removes the need for biopsies, which are painful and expensive and take weeks to deliver a result. ""You can see all the nerves in the eye within 10 seconds and instantly know if the patient has neuropathy."" Professor Efron's honour is for eminent service in the field of clinical optometry, particularly in vision correction and corneal physiology. He is best known for his pivotal role in the 1990s development of the world's first disposable contact lens.
He does not remember the consultancy fees his lab earned for helping to launch what is now a $4 billion-a-year industry. ""Two Scottish entrepreneurs came to my office and said 'We've got a few of them made up, can you run a little study to see how they perform?' They kept falling out of people's eyes. I had to help redesign them."" Professor Efron said he was known for his science, his flamboyant bow ties and his nationality. ""I wear my Australianness on my sleeve. (Receiving) the highest level of award from my nation was poignant for me, because I'm ever so proud of being Australian."" Two sitting vice-chancellors and a recently retired one were also among the higher education figures to feature in today's awards. Deborah Terry, the head of Curtin University, was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), while David Battersby, the long-serving head of Federation University - formerly the University of Ballarat - was made a Member (AM). Ross Milbourne, who retired last July after 12 years at the helm of the University of Technology, Sydney, was also awarded an AO. He was responsible for hiring renowned architect Frank Gehry to design the UTS's business school. John Story, University of Queensland chancellor, receives an AO.

Once-a-week injection for diabetics on PBS
THOUSANDS of Australians with Type 2 diabetes will soon be able to have just one injection a week instead of up to 14 and save up to $1600 a year under a new Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing.
Health Minister Sussan Ley today will announce the new once-a-week diabetes drug exenatide (Bydureon) will be listed on the taxpayer-funded PBS, improving the lives of up to 20,000 Australians.
The $70 million announcement on new medicines to be listed on the PBS will also include breakthrough treatments for cervical cancer and other life-changing illnesses.
And the new diabetes treatments are expected to be cost neutral because they provide alternatives to existing treatments.
""As one of our most prominent chronic diseases, Type 2 diabetes is placing a significant cost on the nation's health and finances at nearly $1 billion per year,"" Ms Ley said.
""According to Diabetes Australia, there were about 4000 amputations last year that could have been avoided with better daily management of a patient's condition. Our hospitals also saw over 900,000 diabetes-related admissions."" Ms Ley said subsidising innovative medicines like these that made it easier for thousands of patients to keep on top of their diabetes and better manage their medication, not only saved them time and money, but also the health system.
The PBS allows millions of Australians to secure subsidised access to lifesaving drugs.
In further announcements to help diabetes sufferers, linagliptin (Trajenta) and linagliptin with metformin (Trajentamet) as well as vildagliptin (Galvus) and vildagliptin with metformin (Galvumet) will also be made available under the new September listings, providing patients with additional treatment options for Type 2 diabetes.
The drugs are used to lower blood sugar levels.
By saving money on some prescription drugs through methods that will include using generic medicines and driving tougher bargains with the drug companies, the Turnbull Government will spend $60 million to list bevacizumab (Avastin) on the PBS for the treatment of persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer where surgery or radiation is not a viable treatment for women.
""Our announcement will help save the lives of over 200 Australian women who aren't responding to conventional treatments for their cervical cancer and therapy was previously out of reach at $55,000 per course of treatment,"" Ms Ley said.
""They will now pay just $6.20 per script if they're a concessional patient or $38.10 if they're a general patient.
""However, these breakthrough medicines also come at a significant cost to taxpayers and we must be able to pay for them."" The drugs will be on the PBS from September 1.

Caitlyn's courage an inspiration
DESPITE the double whammy of a brain tumour and diabetes, Caitlyn Meiklejohn counts herself lucky.
Caitlyn, 11, was diagnosed in late 2011 with a form of diabetes, triggered, as her family would only later learn, by a brain tumour.
A year later she underwent a hugely risky neurosurgical biopsy and began treatment for a malignant brain tumour in late 2012.
Father Neil Meiklejohn said despite the severity of her illness and punishing therapy, at Christmas last year, Caitlyn declared she considered herself fortunate.
""She looked around at kids of her age in isolation or who wouldn't be coming out of hospital and acknowledged that she was lucky,"" he said.
The brave Warwick sixth-grader was soon up and about helping others. Caitlyn began fundraising for children's cancer charity, Camp Quality. Knowing she would lose her hair to chemo, Caitlyn lobbied friends and family to shave their heads in solidarity, raising almost $15,000 among other fundraisers.
Her efforts saw her awarded the 2013 Pride of Australia Child of Courage Medal at a ceremony in Brisbane last month. She is now eligible for the People's Choice Medal including $10,000 for herself and $10,000 for her charity. Readers can vote at prideofaustralia.com.au until October 28.

Eye-in-the-sky technology aids fight against diabetes
THE parents of children with type 1 diabetes live in constant fear of a low blood sugar attack that could send their child into a coma, but new technology has come to the rescue.
Tidepool can collect readings from the child's insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitor and activity trackers such as FitBit, and upload them to the Cloud.
It will allow parents and doctors to obtain reports that see patterns in a child's insulin levels connected to sport, birthday parties, eating times and restaurant visits, allowing them to better predict how much insulin a child will need around these events.
Eventually, the information will allow parents to be alerted via a watch or a mobile phone when their child's blood sugar readings are crashing. Experts hope the technology could advance the development of an artificial pancreas, where a continuous glucose monitor could be linked to an insulin pump and automatically adjust a patient's insulin levels as required.

Diabetes cure hopes
VICTORIAN patients with type 1 diabetes will trial a cancer drug in the hope that it could give them better blood- sugar control, easing their reliance on insulin or even preventing it.
The study of people who have been newly diagnosed with the auto-immune condition will assess if the drug can slow or stop the destruction of insulin-producing cells.
In people with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops making insulin so the body cannot turn glucose into energy, leaving them to rely on insulin injections or a pump to stay alive.
Royal Melbourne Hospital endocrinologist Dr John Wentworth said the anti-cancer drug, Gleevec, was identified as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes after it had an unusual effect on some people who had leukaemia and the auto-immune condition.
""They noticed that these patients were getting low sugar readings and their insulin levels were too high... many of these patients were eventually able to stop taking insulin,"" he said.
Studies in animal models have found that the drug could effectively ""cure"" mice of type 1 diabetes. The trial of 66 people in Victoria and the US, which has begun recruiting, aims to work out if the drug can improve the pancreas' ability to make insulin and help people reduce their dose.
""We hope to prove that the drug, Gleevec, can slow or stop the auto-immune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in those newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes,"" Dr Wentworth said. ""In the best-case scenario, it will get people off insulin and there are a lot of animal and case report data from humans to suggest that's what this drug can do, but we need to trial it first."" The first patient to sign up to the trial was Victorian Bryce McDonald, 21, who began to suffer from fatigue, constant thirst and regular visits to the toilet late last year.
After weighing up the potential side-effects of the drug, which can include nausea, diarrhoea, skin rash and a low blood count, against benefits, he decided to take part.
The trial aims to help give doctors a better insight into a condition affecting up to 120,000 Australians.
To take part in the trial, people must be aged 18-45 and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes less than three months ago.

Study gives diabetics new hope
SCIENTISTS have hailed stem-cell research into a cure for diabetes as potentially the biggest medical breakthrough since antibiotics.
It could result in an end to insulin injections, and to the disabling and deadly complications of the disease, such as strokes and heart attacks, blindness and kidney disease.
The treatment involves making insulin-producing cells from stem cells. Harvard University researchers said they had made a ""giant leap forward"" in the quest to find a cure for type 1 diabetes.
The disease occurs when the immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin we need to turn the sugar in food into energy. Unable to make any insulin, type 1 diabetics need regular injections to stop blood sugar levels from fluctuating wildly.
But the research also offers hope to people with type 2 diabetes, in which the body doesn't make insulin or the insulin doesn't work properly. The lab-grown cells are just one step away from being trialled in people.

WA patients lose limbs to diabetes
Surgeons had to amputate 439 limbs from WA patients last year as more people had serious complications from type 2 diabetes.
New figures released for National Diabetes Week show foot ulcers alone accounted for 10,000 hospital admissions in Australia last year, and many resulted in patients losing all or part of limbs.
More than 4400 Australians, or 85 a week, had feet or legs amputated because of diabetes.
Neil Cole, of Morley, had no idea he had a serious injury to one of his feet one day, until his wife spotted a trail of blood.
Years of nerve damage and loss of circulation from his type 2 diabetes meant Mr Cole's feet were so numb he did not realise he had a deep cut while doing home renovations in bare feet.
Mr Cole, an electorate officer for Mt Lawley MLA Michael Sutherland, said that although the large cut took many months to heal, he considered himself lucky not to have lost a limb.
""I now see a podiatrist every five weeks, wear appropriate footwear and manage my diabetes carefully,"" Mr Cole said.
Diabetes WA said diabetes-related foot disease cost Australia about $875 million a year.
In WA, Aboriginal people were 38 times more likely to undergo a major leg amputation compared with non-indigenous people.

Diabetes is a killer, and it's on the rise
Diabetes is a chronic condition that is becoming increasingly common in Australia. While type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood, a lifelong auto-immune disease believed to be caused by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors, type 2 diabetes comes later in life and is largely preventable. Unfortunately, too many of us are overweight, inactive, with a poor diet and bad habits, increasing the risk of diabetes. If you think diabetes is easily fixed with insulin, you are wrong, and perhaps underestimating the dangers. At its worst, poorly managed diabetes can cause heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and lower limb amputation.
An estimated 1.2 million Australians, or 5.1 per cent of the population, had diabetes in 2014-15, the majority type 2. But it is thought that for every four adults who were diagnosed, one would be living without knowing their status. Diabetes is more common in men than women, and prevalence increases with age, to about 16 per cent for those aged 65-74. It is also often associated with other conditions. In 2013, diabetes contributed to 10 per cent of all deaths in Australia, most cases listing diabetes as an associated cause (coronary heart disease was the underlying cause in 23 per cent of those deaths and stroke in 6 per cent). Regrettably, indigenous Australians are 3.5 times more likely than other Australians to have diabetes, and four times more likely to be hospitalised or die from the condition.
Australians with type 2 diabetes have access to various resources but, according to one expert, need more support to manage their condition. Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia in August, Jane Speight from Deakin University and Diabetes Victoria called for a ""paradigm shift"" to improve self-management, while researchers continue searching for better treatments and interventions. Speight cited a study showing one in five diabetics never, or infrequently, ate healthily, and two in three did not engage in physical activity, but there was widespread distress over future health outcomes. ""This suggests that, far from being apathetic or unmotivated to manage their diabetes, many people overestimate their risk of long-term complications and feel burdened or unsupported trying to manage a complex and unrelenting condition,"" she wrote.
Risk factors and issues surrounding access to medical care mean that diabetics in remote areas, particularly indigenous communities, are far more likely to require an amputation. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care has found huge variation in amputation rates, ranging from eight for every 100,000 people in North Sydney and Hornsby in NSW to 91 in outback Northern Territory and 73 in outback Queensland. A Queensland University of Technology study estimates that funding better care of diabetic foot ulcers could save $2.7 billion over five years and prevent thousands of hospitalisations. ""Not only do patients receiving the best care have faster ulcer healing, fewer recurrent ulcers, hospitalisations and amputations, but they also have a better quality of life and we still save thousands of dollars per patient,"" says health economist Rosana Norman.
Common environmental synthetic chemicals may be exacerbating the obesity problem. There is mounting evidence that environmental pollutants such as plasticisers, pesticides and coolants are contributing to metabolic disorders by disrupting the production and regulation of hormones in the body. A Swedish study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, suggests cutting exposure to these chemicals by just 25 per cent could help prevent more than 150,000 cases of diabetes each year in Europe. ""Our findings also speak to the need for a strong regulatory framework that proactively identifies chemical hazards before they are widely used, and the use of safer alternatives,"" it says.
By 2040, the International Diabetes Federation estimates one in 10 adults around the world, about 642 million people, will have diabetes.
Melbourne's Baker IDI Heart & Diabetes Institute, in collaboration with the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, is set to examine the number of new type 2 diabetes diagnoses around the world. It will seek to better identify trends, for example the apparent slowing in rates in the US and feared outbreaks in southeast Asia. ""While we have consistently been hearing about escalating rates of diabetes in Australia, for example, this is based on prevalence and it could be that the incidence actually demonstrates a slowing in the number of diagnosed new cases,"" says the institute's head of population health, Jonathan Shaw.

Health strikes a cord
A SYDNEY toddler has become the youngest person in the world to receive an infusion of her own umbilical cord blood in the hope of preventing diabetes.
Since Lucy Hinchion's birth, doctors routinely tested the 20-month-old's blood for an antibody indicating she was on the path to develop type-1 diabetes.
A baby whose close family member has type-1 diabetes has a 5 per cent chance of developing the auto-immune disease and Lucy's older sister Ava, 7, was diagnosed with diabetes as a toddler.
Lucy recently tested positive for the antibody and was given an infusion of her own cord blood at the Children's Hospital at Westmead.
Cord blood is rich in important and unique immune cells known as regulatory T-cells and stem cells that can be used to treat diseases.
Lucy's mum Sonya, 37, had the foresight at her daughter's birth to store the product with Cell Care Australia on the chance it could be used to treat Ava's diabetes. Ms Hinchion then saw an advert for a trial for babies with a family history of Type-1 diabetes at the hospital's Kids Research Institute.
Professor Maria Craig hopes to recruit more babies to the ground- breaking trial.
""We're using the cord blood to switch off the immune process that already commenced in Lucy and... set her on the pathway to type-1 diabetes,"" Prof Craig said.
""We believe the right strategy is to get in very early at this young age, when we have the greatest chance of success at resetting their immune system."" Lucy will be monitored as she grows to see if she develops the disease and Ms Hinchion urged other families to join the trial. ""We have given Lucy a fighting chance of not developing diabetes and we're thinking positively,"" she said. Ms Hinchion said storing Lucy's cord blood cost about $3000, which is much cheaper than the ongoing costs of diabetes treatment.

Diabetes can spur dementia
New York
Researchers have discovered that people found to have diabetes in their 50s are significantly more likely than others to be in mental decline by their 70s. The study, published on Monday in The Annals of Internal Medicine, started in 1990. Scientists examined 13,351 black and white adults, ages 48 to 67, for diabetes and pre-diabetes using self-reported physician diagnoses and glucose control tests. They also administered widely used tests of memory, reasoning, problem solving and planning. About 13per cent had diabetes at the start. The researchers followed them with five periodic examinations over the next 20 years. The researchers found people with diabetes had a 30per cent larger decline in mental acuity than those without the disease. Diabetes can impair blood circulation, and the authors suggest that the association of diabetes with thinking and memory problems may be the result of damage to small blood vessels in the brain.

ARE YOU ON THE ROAD TO DIABETES?
Diabetes is the fastest-growing chronic health problem plaguing Aussies, yet many of us wouldn't know how to spot if we were at risk of the deadly disease, discovers Rosie King
One Australian is diagnosed with diabetes every five minutes. Of those, 85-95 per cent will be diagnosed with type 2, a condition that's both deadly and preventable.
Sof Andrikopoulos, CEO of the Australian Diabetes Society, describes type 1 and type 2 diabetes as diseases of the pancreas, in which the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin to regulate the glucose levels in our blood.
""With type 1, the immune system actually kills the cells that produce insulin so there's a complete deficiency. With type 2, the insulin-producing cells don't work efficiently so there's a relative deficiency.""
Type 2 used to typically affect men and women who were over 55. That's all changed now, Andrikopoulos says: ""When I started in diabetes research 25 years ago, you had to be over 55 to get type 2 but now we're seeing it in young adults, adolescents and even in children under 10. It all comes down to our lifestyle - the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are obese.""
To stop type 2 diabetes taking hold, be aware of signs that might indicate a fast-track to diagnosis. Left undiagnosed and untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to illness, amputation, even death.
SIGNS YOU'RE AT RISK If any of these ring true, now's the time to act. Talk to your GP or health care professional
EXPANDING WAISTLINE ""Waist circumference is strongly linked with diabetes risk,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If you're a man and your waistline is 102cm or above or you're a woman with a waist circumference of 88cm or higher, that's a very telling sign you could be heading down the path towards diabetes.
""Measuring your waist is easy, too. Just grab a measuring tape and wrap it around your belly. If it measures more than it should, it's a good idea to see someone about managing your weight, because as well as diabetes, you could be at risk of developing heart disease.""
BAD DIET ""A poor diet will accelerate your progression to type 2 diabetes but little tweaks can go a long way,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""Cutting down the number of sugary drinks you have or how many sugars you put in your coffee every day can mean a big reduction in your discretionary kilojoule intake. Over six months, the benefits of that are huge.""
It's a case of minimising the amount of treat foods you have now, so that you don't have to give them up forever.
""Once you've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, diet is critical to managing it properly,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""That means saying goodbye to all excessive kilojoules - the burgers, the pizza, the soft drinks. It all has to go.""
It's not just about avoiding certain foods, it's also a matter of eating enough fruit, veg, nuts, wholegrains and fish, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE ""Just as exercise improves insulin resistance, a lack of activity makes it harder for those insulin-producing cells to do their job, which accelerates the development of diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""You don't have to run a marathon or lift 100kg at the gym every day but you do need to move regularly. Walking for 30 minutes every day is a cheap and easy way to give your body what it needs and minimise the risk.""
FAMILY HISTORY ""If one of your parents has type 2 diabetes, your likelihood of developing it rises by 30 per cent,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If both parents have type 2 diabetes, that number jumps to 70 per cent. We can't control our genes or our parents but we can control other risk factors.
""If you have a family history of diabetes, be vigilant about being active, ensure your weight is in a healthy range, don't smoke and don't drink excessively. That's my advice to anyone, regardless of their history.""
SIGNS YOU'RE IN TROUBLE These symptoms of type 2 diabetes require immediate attention
FREQUENT TOILET VISITS ""Going to the toilet more than twice a night is a reasonably good indicator of type 2 diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""Once your glucose levels reach a certain concentration in your blood, your kidneys start excreting the glucose in your urine so you'll need to go more often.""
EXCESSIVE THIRST ""If you're going to the toilet a lot, you're losing a significant amount of water in your urine, which leads to excessive thirst,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""But that doesn't have to be the case.
Too much glucose in the blood can also flick the thirst switch in the brain so you'll continuously feel as though you need to be glugging down glasses of water.""
SENSITIVE SKIN ""When glucose levels are too high, our infection-fighting white blood cells don't work properly so skin irritations can be slow to heal,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""You might notice a rash that's hard to get rid of or a wound that takes an unusually long time to heal.
This shows your immune system is weak, which could mean your diabetes risk is elevated.""
BLURRED VISION AND NUMBNESS ""I'd expect you to have every other symptom as well because if it's come to the stage of blurred vision and numb fingertips, you have out-of-control diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""Put the newspaper down and get to your doctor quick-smart.""
WHAT ABOUT FATIGUE?
""Fatigue is a big but difficult one,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""With diabetes, your cells aren't working effectively or efficiently to secrete enough insulin, which can wreak havoc on your immune system and energy levels. It can be difficult to know what's causing a person's fatigue because it's a symptom of so many medical conditions - and our busy lives - but it's something to be mindful of if you're concerned about diabetes.""

Crash diet trial may aid diabetes fight
A CRASH diet could help millions defeat diabetes.
In a medical trial, a handful of people suffering from the disease were able to throw away their tablets after going on an extreme low-calorie diet for just two months.
And 18 months later, some were still free of symptoms.
So far the diet has only been tested on 11 patients. But a $4.4million trial involving 280 diabetics is about to start.
These men and women will live on meal-replacement shakes and soups. They will be allowed to take in only 3300 kilojoules a day.
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition. It occurs when the pancreas does not make enough insulin and the insulin that is made does not work properly.
Scientists believe that fat surrounding vital organs could be the key to understanding the condition.
This fat is thought to clog up the pancreas and liver, cutting insulin production and stopping insulin from being used properly. But crash dieting plunges the body into starvation mode, the fat is burned off and the vital organs are freed up.

Updating dietary guidelines will stem diabetes epidemic
DIABETES is the epidemic of our age and the biggest challenge for the Australian health system.
World Diabetes Day is next Tuesday and we should all use it to pause and consider why we are failing to control the prevalence of this life-affecting, life-limiting disease.
Diabetes Australia says 280 Australians develop diabetes every day, or one person every five minutes.
It is the fastest-growing chronic condition in the nation and so many of the cases are preventable.
Meanwhile, many patients are paddling hard against the stream, doing as they are advised, but losing the fight and developing complications that take eyesight, mobility, circulation and eventually lives.
Why should we care? Because it affects us, it is hurting us or those we care for and we all pay the stratospheric costs of a disease that is too often preventable and reversible.
Of course, there are three kinds of diabetes: Type 1, which is an auto-immune disease that usually hits in childhood and young adulthood; Type 2, which is most often caused by obesity, diet and lifestyle choices; and gestational diabetes, which is something of a mystery but for which being overweight is also a risk factor.
Type 2 is deemed mostly avoidable and controllable, but people are falling like ninepins. More than 85 per cent of diabetes cases in Australia are Type 2, although all types are rising. Most agree that improper eating habits lead to the development of Type 2, but there are different attitudes as to what type of diet will prevent or improve diabetes control.
And this is where a shift in focus must occur.
After all, doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is accepted as insanity.
Brisbane-based registered nutritionist Anthony Power says 80-90 per cent of his patients have diabetes, and they come to him because of complications: kidney dysfunction, eye problems, extreme fatigue.
People with diabetes are routinely told what they should eat and do to help control it and reduce the risk of life-affecting complications.
Of course, they are responsible for what goes in their mouths, but those diagnosed with a disease generally turn to authoritative advice. But so many are finding they can't reverse their condition no matter how rigorously they stick to the accepted guidelines.
Power says logic would suggest the guidelines are flawed.
No one can win a battle if they are sparring with the wrong enemy. The Australian Dietary Guidelines, which tell people what to eat and how much in order to be healthy, demonise fats but not carbohydrates.
Increasing numbers of nutritionists are concerned that this practice is the main cause of our collective blow outs, and is particularly affecting those who have already developed diabetes.
The ongoing development and supposed refinement of the guidelines includes peer-reviewed evidence, but a disproportionate number of the studies that are included are sponsored by food companies.
Evidence is increasingly showing that processed food is a slow-acting poison in the modern body, yet the Australian Food and Grocery Council argued last time against upgrading advice to include limiting added sugar, for Pete's sake.
When people are eating Weet-Bix and freshly squeezed juice for breakfast and thinking that is balanced, we have problems.
Labelling also has a lot to answer for. When people think low-fat means healthy - because that is what they are told to go for - instead of understanding it is likely loaded with sugar to ""taste right"", more of us will continue to be sucked into the diabetes vortex.
The Australian Dietary Guidelines are used to inform all Australian government health advice. The guidelines must be updated every 10 years but can get a bit of a touch-up every five if things have gone too awry.
The next major edition is due to be published in 2023 but, by then, eight in 10 Australians over 20 will be overweight or obese and the diabetes diagnoses will have continued its upward spiral.
Given the diabetes train is well and truly off the tracks, a review next year - five years since the last - is desperately needed.
De-coupling or at least exposing the links between the processed food industries and authoritative advice will be a challenge, but it should be mandatory.
People need all the help they can get.

Kiwis solve diabetics' heart disease trigger
Heart disease has long been the biggest killer of diabetics but a group of New Zealand scientists has solved the mystery why. A team of Otago University researchers have identified a number of harmful changes that occur at a molecular level which specifically impact diabetics before heart disease symptoms even begin to present. Lead researcher Dr Rajesh Katare said her team found a normal cell process called autophagy becomes deregulated in diabetic hearts, leading to a loss of cardiac cells which regularly eventuates in heart failure. The breakthrough is significant, with about 60 per cent of diabetics dying from cardiovascular problems as a result of the metabolism disorder. Identifying why diabetics die from heart disease will help physicians find a way to combat it. Dr Katare said there was an increase in autophagy through the activity of the Beclin-1 protein so blocking that protein ""presents an extremely promising target for new treatments of diabetes-related cardiac disease"". ""Given that the growing diabetes epidemic is set to create major global economic and social costs, it is very exciting to have opened up a new research avenue,"" she said.

Diabetes to knock $2.9b off economy Health Older sufferers leave workforce
The indirect economic cost of rising numbers of ageing Australians with diabetes, measured in ""lost productive life years"", is set to hit $2.9 billion a year by 2030, up from $2.1 billion in 2015.
New research, published in BMJ Open on Tuesday, used population growth and disease trend data to estimate the likely cost of the disease among people aged 45 to 64 years old by 2030.
There are about 1.3 million people with diabetes registered with the National Diabetes Services Scheme, directly costing the federal government about $214 million in the last fiscal year, most of whom had the more common type 2 diabetes.
A study commissioned by Diabetes Australia estimated in 2012 the total annual direct and indirect costs of type 1 and 2 diabetes combined could be as much as $6.5 billion.
The latest study involved medical researchers at the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre and Centre for Rural Health, the Garvan Institute for Medical Research and researchers at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra.
It projected the costs of the ageing diabetes sufferers on the nation's economy, measured in lost income, lost tax revenue, lost GDP, lost productive life years and rising welfare costs, would reach $2.9 billion by 2030.
Researchers also found the number of Australians who were out of the labour force due to diabetes, measured in lost productive life years, would hit 21,400 by 2030, up from 18,100 in 2015, an 18 per cent rise over the 15 years to 2030.
The rising number of lost productive life years could lead to a 73 per cent increase in losses in national income from the disease, up from $467 million in 2015 to $807 million in 2030.
""For the government, extra annual welfare payments increased from $311 million in 2015 to $350 million in 2030 (a 13 per cent increase) and lost annual taxation revenue increased from $102 million in 2015 to $166 million in 2030 (63 per cent increase),"" the study results showed.
""A loss of $2.1 billion in GDP was projected for 2015, increasing to $2.9 billion in 2030 attributable to diabetes through its impact on lost productive life years.""
At the individual level, the study also found an increasing income gap between those aged 45 and 64 years old with diabetes who were forced to leave the workforce, compared with those in full-time work without diabetes.
It showed those who ""exited"" the labour force due to the chronic disease had a median weekly personal income of about $393.15 in 2015, compared with full-time workers without the disease in the same age group, who earned $1306.81.
""By 2030, the income gap between these two groups is projected to be even greater; with those out of the labour force due to their diabetes receiving an annual income four times lower than that of full-time workers without diabetes,"" the study reads.
The study authors also noted their research did not take into account other more indirect costs of the disease in Australia, such as ""informal carer costs"", but the high costs of the disease and its burden on the health system was ""an issue requiring urgent policy attention"".

Experts warn diabetes could bankrupt health system
THE release of the World Diabetes Atlas has experts warning a massive rise in diabetes looms as a catastrophe set to ""bankrupt the Australian health system"".
Twenty years ago, an alarming rise in the disease led to forecasts it would reach 100 million cases worldwide this year - instead it has rocked to 382 million and is on a trajectory to reach almost 600 million by 2035, or 1 in 10 people. There will be more than five million deaths from the disease this year and the bill for care, medication and treatment will hit $587 billion. Plus there are an estimated 175 million cases that are undiagnosed.
Release of the report ahead of the World Diabetes Congress in Melbourne next month shows 1.7 million Australians now have it, a similar number are at risk and by 2035 some 2.3 million Australians will have it.
About 44 per cent of the expected 9500 deaths in Australia due to diabetes this year are expected to be people aged under 60.
Congress chairman Professor Paul Zimmet of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute said: ""Unless we do something about it, it is going to have severe effects on the economy. With obesity it is the largest public health issue, with the potential to bankrupt the Australian health system."" The most common form of diabetes - Type 2, which is associated with lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise - is now also being seen in children in Australia. Complications can include heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, feet problems leading to amputation, sleep apnoea, and fatty liver. It is also on track to overtake alcohol as the major cause of cirrhosis of the liver.
The atlas shows South East Asia and the Western Pacific as the regions with the highest rates.
It also shows the heavy impact the disease is having on indigenous peoples around the world as lifestyles and diet change.
Professor Alex Brown, head of the Aboriginal Research Unit at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, said a majority of adults over 50 in some indigenous communities will have it.
""It is probably the leading cause of preventable blindness in Aboriginal Australia,"" he said. President of the International Diabetes Federation Sir Michael Hirst said "" environments must be created that lay the foundations for healthy living.""

Three-yearly test urged for over 40s
All West Australians aged over 40 should be tested for diabetes at least every three years, according to a blueprint for dealing with the epidemic over the next decade.
New diabetes care standards being released for World Diabetes Day today are aimed at managing the 114,000 West Australians already diagnosed with diabetes and preventing thousands more with pre-diabetes from getting the condition.
The Australian-first standards set out who should be tested and when and what care they should receive, including specific groups such as children and pregnant women.
They recommend that people who are over 40 and at high risk of type 2 diabetes because of factors such as obesity or high blood pressure be screened yearly. Others over 40 should have their blood glucose levels checked every three years to see if they have diabetes or are pre-diabetic.
Newly diagnosed children and teenagers should have intensive education and monitoring and then follow-up care at least three-monthly.
Developed by the WA Health Department's diabetes and endocrine health network, the document sets out for the first time a vision of what diabetes prevention and care should look like throughout WA by 2025.
Diabetes expert Tim Davis said it was a benchmark for the management of diabetes and showed people what they should reasonably expect.
""The network spent considerable time reviewing diabetes services throughout the State and we're not in the blame game but this document is really to make sure people in WA, no matter where they are, have the same standards of care applied to them,"" Professor Davis said.
Diabetes WA chief executive Andrew Wagstaff welcomed the new standards but said State funding for diabetes prevention and management also needed to be reviewed.
He wants a parliamentary inquiry into how best to prevent type 2 diabetes, which makes up 87 per cent of all diabetes cases and is Australia's fastest growing chronic condition.

Young diabetic the first to be fitted with artificial pancreas
An Australian child has become the first person to be fitted with a device that acts as an artificial pancreas.
Four-year-old Xavier Hames, who has type 1 diabetes, will no longer require four daily injections after a number of tubes were inserted under his skin, connecting to a small black box that acts as an insulin pump.
Xavier wears the device in a small pouch at his waist after it was fitted at Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for Children on Wednesday morning.
Professor Tim Jones from PMH said the contraption, developed as a result of clinical trials across Australia, would help families sleep better at night.
It is able to sense glucose levels, predicts when they will drop and stops insulin being delivered unless it is needed.
This helps prevent hypoglycaemic attacks, particularly at night, which can cause seizures, induce comas and can sometimes be fatal.
""If it's able to stop hypoglycaemia and give people confidence that hypoglycaemia is not going to occur it'll make a huge difference to lives,"" Professor Jones said.
While insulin pumps had existed for some time, he said ""the difference with this pump, is that it's got a hypoglycaemia predictive algorithm within it, a small computer inside of it, that will give people a lot more confidence"".
Professor Jones said the pump delivered insulin through a plastic tube which was pushed under the skin, along with a sensor, also placed under the skin. ""That's done every three days, it's a simple procedure.""
Xavier's family has been taught how to insert the device at home.
It is now commercially available, costs about $10,000 and can be used for both adults and children.
Xavier's mother, Naomi Hames, said the device gave her peace of mind because up until now she was only confident of his well-being if she was up every hour during the night to monitor her son. She was now looking forward to not having to give her son daily injections.

Diabetes link to deadly diseases
Perth researchers are warning about the risks from poorly controlled type 1 diabetes in children, after finding a link with eye disease, stroke and kidney disease in early adulthood.
A study involving the Telethon Kids Institute and Princess Margaret Hospital found girls were at particular risk from diabetes complications and were 11 times more likely to die before the age of 40 than other girls.
The Diabetes Research WA-funded research was led by TKI student Matthew Cooper and supervised by PMH Children's Diabetes Centre co-director Elizabeth Davis.
They tracked the health records of more than 1300 West Australians diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in childhood.
""We discovered that by early adulthood, 32 of these patients had been hospitalised and treated for a vascular complication, mostly eye disease which can obviously have a huge impact on a person's quality of life,"" Mr Cooper said. ""We also found rates of end-stage kidney disease and stroke were significantly elevated compared to the general population.""
He said that despite improvements in devices to self-monitor glucose and deliver insulin, complications such as stroke, diabetic eye disease and kidney damage remained a reality for people with type 1 diabetes.
Professor Davis said poor blood-sugar control during childhood and adolescence led to an increased risk of medical complications even in young adults. Women, people from low socio-economic backgrounds, and those who had suffered severe hypoglycaemia, were at particular risk.
Diabetes Research WA executive director Sherl Westlund said the Perth researchers had earlier found that children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were more than twice as likely to be affected by mental health disorders such as anxiety as young adults, when compared with their peers.
""The group has also found that females with childhood onset type 1 diabetes have an early adulthood mortality rate - before the age of 40 - that is 11 times higher than the general population,"" she said.
""This type of research helps us understand exactly who is most at risk from complications of type 1 diabetes, and when and why those issues show up.""

""A sudden swollen foot revealed my diabetes; days later I was almost blind""
Susan Harvey, 65, thought her swollen foot was the result of an insect bite. When doctors gave her the correct diagnosis, her life was turned upside-down. She tells her story to Beverly Hadgraft
""My mum was in her 60s when she got diabetes.
I exercised regularly and rarely needed more than a pill for a headache, so I thought to myself, that will never happen to me.
I cared for Mum until she died, and I'd hit my 60s by the time I woke on Australia Day 2009 with my right foot as big as a balloon.
I couldn't walk on it, so I called a taxi and got myself to hospital.
I told the doctors I must have been bitten by something as they took blood tests and did X-rays.
But it turned out to be something much worse than that.
I had type 2 diabetes. The swelling in my foot was due to osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone. Osteomyelitis of the foot is apparently surprisingly common in diabetics. I had two broken toes and hadn't even realised because of the damage the diabetes had already caused to the nerves in my feet.
I was put on a very strong antibiotic drip and insulin. I felt quite stunned. However, there was worse to come.
While I was in hospital, I'd buy a newspaper every day. However, a few days into my treatment, I picked it up and couldn't see the print. It was just a grey blur.
""I can't read the paper!"" I said to the nurse and she told me not to worry, and that my vision would come back in about six weeks.
A doctor gave me the same reassurance and I now realise that, back then, people didn't realise that diabetes puts you at high risk of eye disease.
It wasn't until Id left hospital and seen a diabetes specialist that I was sent to get my eyes checked. Finally the diagnosis was confirmed: I had an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy.
My high glucose levels had led to damage to the blood vessels in the back of my eye.
The treatment freaked me out.
I had to have needles in my eye every month. I also needed laser treatment in my right eye, then three lots of surgery to control the bleeding at the back of both eyes.
I had to have my right cataract done and my left one will also need treatment, as early cataracts are also common in diabetics.
The specialist eventually said that my eyes had been so badly damaged there was nothing he could do to restore my vision.
I live by myself in my Sydney home and was very frightened that I might go completely blind. The surgery was especially distressing.
It was around that time that I reached out to the Macular Disease Foundation Australia for help. They were so kind and helpful. I've ended up volunteering three days a week for them and I've found it a great comfort.
Fortunately, my sight has been preserved sufficiently that I can still read with my left eye with the aid of magnifying glasses.
I can also do my own shopping, although I have to bring things right up to my face to read the labels.
However, I've lost the ability to do simple pleasures such as knitting or sewing.
I'm still only 65. The diabetes is now under control but I so wish I'd gone for regular eye tests before this point. I thought my eyesight was fine so I hadn't visited an optometrist in years. I'm sure if I'd done so, they would've seen what was happening at the back of my eyes and perhaps diagnosed my condition earlier.
At least I can tell my story now and, hopefully, it will remind others to have an eye check at a minimum every two years, especially if they are or even think they could be diabetic.
I can't emphasise that enough.
Look at me - I'm paying dearly for what I didn't do.""

SKINNY GENES
Discovery heralds hope for diabetics
EXCLUSIVE: New hope on diabetes after SA weight gain breakthrough SOUTH Australian scientists have unlocked the secrets of the fat gene and are a step closer to treatments that could reverse obesity and eventually prevent Type 2 diabetes.
Breakthrough research by scientists at the SA Health and Medical Research Institute has revealed that the MNK gene is involved in weight gain.
Their discovery will be used to develop drugs and treatments to fight obesity around the world.
Head researcher Professor Chris Proud, the leader of SAHMRI's Nutrition and Metabolism team, said the gene was present in everyone but its role in obesity and the development of Type 2 diabetes was only triggered by a high-fat diet.
""This is quite a breakthrough,"" he said.
""We had no idea they (the genes) were involved in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. ""Normally (the MNK genes) are not doing anything bad (in the body)... but testing in animal models found that they were crucial to weight gain when a high-fat diet was consumed."" Prof Proud said the researchers found the MNK genes were responsible for making particular proteins in the body's cells that resulted in weight gain.
""If you become obese, you develop inflammation, especially in your fat tissue... and that inflammation is a large part of all these other adverse effects like cardiovascular disease and diabetes,"" he said.
He added that Type 2 diabetes stemmed from the inflammation in fat tissue. ""It (the inflammation) interferes with the action of insulin being able to function normally."" As part of the research, Prof Proud and his team deleted the MNK gene from mice - something that cannot be done in humans - and fed them a high- fat diet.
Mice with the gene got fat, but those without it did not.
""Unlike the normal mice, the other mice don't get fat, they don't get the inflammation, they didn't get Type 2 diabetes,"" Prof Proud said.
""We found you don't need this gene and it only comes into play when you eat a high-fat diet.
""A lot of genes, if you remove them, the mouse is dead (but) in this case this is not what we saw.
""You can't take the genes out of humans... but we can use a drug which blocks the function of that gene."" Prof Proud said SAHMRI researchers, in collaboration with scientists overseas, will now look to develop drugs that block the function of the MNK genes in the body.
""One possibility is if we develop drugs to block the function of these genes then we might have a way of treating or even reversing some of the effects of overeating,"" he said. ""It could help prevent people getting Type 2 diabetes or improve it if they have it already."" Prof Proud said the research could potentially help combat obesity, which claims millions of lives and costs billions of dollars in health care around the world each year.
""It's one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. There are lots of people who are overweight and they are going to suffer in the future because of these problems,"" he said.
Diabetes SA general manager Fiona Benton said she supported any research to help combat Type 2 diabetes.
""Diabetes SA supports research into the field of diabetes (because) it's the key to making an advancement in the prevention and management of diabetes and the search for a cure,"" she said.
""We're excited to hear about any research initiatives that may in this case impact on the increasing number of people affected by Type 2 diabetes."" Prof Proud will present his team's findings at a SAHMRI breakfast this morning.
SAHMRI BREAKTHROUGH
TRIALS on mice have linked a gene to weight gain.
THE breakthrough is by researchers at the SA Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI).
SCIENTISTS removed the MNK gene from mice and fed them a high-fat diet - those without the gene did not put on weight.
THE gene is present in everyone and the breakthrough may lead to drugs to block its function for people fighting obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

Experience meets social purpose to powerful effect
EXCLUSIVE The days were long for a young Phil Chronican as he worked his way up the corporate ladder through the heady 1980s at Westpac. But after he married the love of his life, Leanne, a diabetic, some nights were even longer.
""Early in our married wife, I would wake up in the middle of the night and realise she had gone into a coma. It's one of the things you become aware of when you are living with a diabetic,"" he says.
Leanne was diagnosed with diabetes when she was five.
She and Chronican met when they were 19. A few years later, her kidneys failed and in 1991 she was the beneficiary of an experimental program at Sydney's Westmead Hospital doing pancreas transplants. But as a result she lost her sight in one eye. And after her kidney failure, she could never have children.
Leanne's personal battles didn't stop her joining in her husband's passions for bike riding and golf, or joining him on the ski slopes. But in July 2012, she tragically lost her courageous battle for survival.
""It was never hard for me when thinking about the causes that are important to me to focus on medical research,"" Chronican says.
""To me the landmark thing was the work on research that led to the transplant program at Westmead - that extended her life for 10-20 years."" After stepping down as the head of ANZ's Australian operations earlier this year, Chronican yesterday joined the board of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), his first appointment in his post-banking life.
""When I think about a post-executive life, it is easy to talk about company directorships and no doubt in due course I will do a few of them,"" says Chronican, who is also on the board of NSW Treasury Corporation.
""But I have this old-fashioned ethos that people who have led careers in big public companies - a lot of benefits come with that. It is only appropriate you give something back,"" The JDRF board includes former Nine Network executive Jeff Browne and Jim Best, former Dean of the Melbourne Medical School. The chief executive is Mike Wilson.
The advisory board, which meets once a year, boasts former and current CBA bosses Ralph Norris and Ian Narev, Telstra CEO-elect Andy Penn, Wesfarmers CEO Richard Goyder, former QBE chairman Belinda Hutchinson, UBS Australia boss Matthew Grounds and former Ramsay Health Care executive Shaun Larkin.
Norris and Goyder have previously spoken of their personal battles with diabetes.
The former was diagnosed with late-onset type 1 diabetes that forced him step down from his successful 10-year role as chief executive of the Auckland Savings Bank in 2001. He went on to run Air New Zealand and CBA.
Goyder's youngest son, William, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2007. For years, Goyder felt the guilt of leaving his wife to deal with the twice-nightly blood-sugar monitoring duties when he was away from home on business.
Over his 35-year career at Westpac and ANZ, Chronican had a long association with JDRF, putting together teams to compete in an annual charity bike ride in South Australia's Barossa Valley.
""We have raised quite a bit of money over the years. So JDRF was a straightforward decision to get involved in. I always promised that when I had the time, I would work with them,"" he says.
Wilson says JDRF - which won Charity of the Year in the Australian Charity Awards last year - has realised in recent years that just being a good fundraiser won't get the job done for people with type 1 diabetes.
""If we really want to change lives, we have to influence the whole research system - from basic science to pharma companies to regulatory and reimbursement challenges."" He says the directors of the board and advisory board are not simply asked ""to bring their wallet or their phone book into meetings, as is sometimes the case with non-profit boards"".
""We want every director to bring the best of their accumulated business experience and apply it towards a social purpose and that can be a really powerful mix."" Browne, appointed to the board in March, has two children with diabetes. ""Fortunately we have been able to manage it with them. But in the course of a number of trips to hospital, I have become aware of others that haven't been able to manage it,"" he says.
""Some children have even died. That was a tragedy. (It was) very upsetting for my family and for me personally and drove me to get more involved in the JDRF when I had the time."" And Chronican will continue to draw inspiration from the memory of Leanne."" In the year after she died, I came to the second lap of the bike ride in the Barossa and wondered if I could go for another 80km,"" he says. ""But I thought: 'If my diabetic wife can do this, I can'. So off I went.""

Pocket-size lifeline for kids
THOUSANDS of children with Type 1 diabetes will be given pocket-sized continuous glucose monitoring devices that will save lives and spare families $4000 a year.
The device eliminates the need for children to have 10-15 finger pricks a day to test their glucose levels.
The new kits will save kids from being woken up in the middle of the night for blood tests to check their glucose levels, and can be combined with insulin pumps to provide more accurate doses.
Malcolm Turnbull will announce today that if re-elected his government will devote $54 million to ensure that thousands of families can secure the pocket-sized gadgets for the first time.
In his first major health policy announcement of the campaign, the Prime Minister will confirm that all children and young adults under 21 will be eligible.
""It will help reduce possible visits to emergency departments and missed school days by allowing families and children to better self-manage their diabetes,"" Mr Turnbull said.
""Most importantly, it will help reduce stress and anxiety for children and their parents, and even save lives."" Mr Turnbull has also averted an election war with pathologists over their threats to leave patients out of pocket for blood, urine and Pap smear tests in a separate deal that will cap rents at collection centres.
The fight with pathologists had sparked warnings that tests could soon cost patients $30 and triggered a major campaign in marginal seats across Australia.
Today's announcement on a deal to help kids with diabetes was hailed by Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation CEO Mike Wilson as a huge win for families who had campaigned for years for CGM subsidies. Providing 24-hour-a-day glucose monitoring, the kits measure blood sugar levels through a small device that is inserted under the skin and left in place for up to six days at a time.
""With Type 1 diabetes you need insulin to stay alive and you can be diagnosed when babies are just a few months old,"" Mr Wilson said. ""Most commonly, the diagnosis is marked by a week to 10 days in hospital with significant fears for the life of the child.
""You have to deliver that insulin four or five times a day just to stay alive or risk complication including blindness and heart disease, kidney failure and even amputation. CGM... means greatly reduced risk of... coma and death. The government estimates it will save families up to $50,000.

Two-faced protein to aid diabetes fight
THE discovery of a protein's split nature could help develop a vaccine for type 1 diabetes.
The discovery that a protein in the brain and pancreas changes shape when it turns itself off and on is the first small step towards better drugs or a vaccine to treat the condition.
Monash University Associate Professor Ashley Buckle said GAD 65 had previously been linked to type 1 diabetes because the body made antibodies against the protein.
The new findings, published in the journal PNAS, show how the body interacts with the protein differently, depending on whether it is on or off. Prof Buckle said the protein had been used in clinical trials of a vaccine to protect against type 1 diabetes.
""The idea to immunise an individual with GAD 65 to help the immune system develop a tolerance against it, to stop or at least dampen the immune reaction, is a good one,"" he said. The trials had been unsuccessful, but the new research could change that, now analysing how the protein interacted with a human antibody.

Paleo diet no defence against diabetes
DEVOTEES of the paleo diet shouldn't bank on it beating type 2 diabetes, with a leading health researcher warning there is no evidence that eating like our ancestors ameliorates the medical condition.
Obesity is a major risk factor in developing type 2 diabetes and lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, are effective in reducing the risk of becoming insulin dependent.
While the caveman diet involves avoiding processed food and refined sugars, it also involves cutting out important sources of fibre and calcium, such as wholegrains and diary.
Advocates of the diet, including chef Pete Evans, believe it is an effective way to reduce weight and gain glycaemic control, while some people even claim it can get them off their diabetes medication.
Associate Professor Sof Andrikopoulos, a researcher at the University of Melbourne's Department of Medicine at Austin Hospital, reviewed all the scientific, peer-reviewed evidence on the diet and the condition. Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia, he said the diet was often skewed by individual interpretation, with some people promoting a high intake of animal fats. The diet relies on vegetables and meats with no processed foods.

No hiding diabetes
IN a world first, the Austin Hospital is routinely testing all its older patients for diabetes - and has found 5 per cent have it without knowing it.
At any one time, a third of these patients admitted to wards or through the emergency department have it. And a further third were at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Those with it can be treated early to avoid severe health complications and those found to be at risk can then change their lifestyle to avoid developing the full-blown disease.
The Austin's endocrinology department director, Professor Jeffrey Zajac, said more than 13,000 patients had been tested since June last year.
""In hospitals that aren't doing this, 5 per cent of the patients admitted will have diabetes and nobody will know they have it,"" Prof Zajac said.
""Because the symptoms of diabetes are very subtle, most people have diabetes for an average of five years before they are diagnosed.
""The earlier you diagnose the diabetes, the more you can do to prevent the complications such as blindness, the kidney failure, heart disease, blood vessel disease and foot amputations."" Every patient aged 54 and over is given the HbA1c blood test, which gives an average of the blood sugar level over the past three months.
About 10 patients a week are found with HbA1c levels so high that they are at significant risk of developing severe health complications.
""The old model is, you wait until someone calls you before you help,"" Prof Zajac said. ""But we don't wait any more. It's a very new way of doing it."" Endocrinology registrar Natalie Nana said doctors reviewed management of newly diagnosed patients daily, and their GPs were advised of further tests and treatment.
The screening has found 40 per cent of cancer patients and almost half of rheumatology patients have diabetes.

Diabetes win in lap band op
OVERWEIGHT people are resorting to surgery usually reserved for the severely obese for the sake of their health.
And some doctors are now so convinced by the success of lap band surgery in cutting the risk of diabetes that they are calling for it to be available to anyone weighing 80kg and above.
""The reality is for the vast majority of people non-surgical intervention is not effective, it doesn't achieve sustained weight loss that can put diabetes into remission,"" Dr John Wentworth said.
He has led a study by Monash University's Centre for Obesity Research that found people who were overweight and had the surgery lost an average 11kg.
Current guidelines say lap band surgery should only be performed on those with a body mass index of 35 or above - or weighing more than 110-115kg.The operation can cost up to $15,000 and requires patients to commit to a lifestyle change.

The My Kitchen Rules judge also publicly questioned if esteemed scientist Assoc Prof Sof Andrikopoulos' work was being bankrolled by multinational companies, while labelling the researcher a ""so-called professional"" who was ""clutching at straws"".
""You do have to ask the question... who is funding this study, does this university or the professor have any ties with any pharmaceutical or multinational funding?"" Evans posted. ""Perhaps this professor might like to work with real scientists who are passionate about getting the TRUTH out there and doing studies on... wait for it... HUMANS."" As disclosed in the research published in Nature journal, Nutrition and Diabetes, Assoc Prof Andrikopoulos' study was undertaken at the Austin Hospital and is funded by the Federal Government's National Health and Medical Research Council.
The university confirmed Assoc Prof Andrikopoulos was funded by the NHMRC to undertake diabetes and obesity research.
""(His) position is funded by a research fellowship from the National Health and Medical Research Centre,"" a University of Melbourne statement said.
""This study was not funded by pharmaceutical companies or food companies and all funding is clearly stated in the Nature paper, which is a highly respected international peer-reviewed journal."" Evans yesterday clarified his Facebook post, saying he rejected the parameters of the study because it placed too much emphasis on fat and did not represent what a paleo lifestyle was about.
He said the findings referred to a very small portion of the population already battling poor health, while some people felt threatened by what paleo advocates promote.
""It threatens a lot of big business and government- based funding. It also goes against what the government-aligned health agencies has been telling us for decades, which makes them look pretty stupid, when this way of life is enriching so many people's lives,"" Evans said.
Assoc Prof Andrikopoulos's research found a paleo-style diet resulted in a 15 per cent weight gain and rising insulin levels in overweight mice. The researchers warned that a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet could carry risks for overweight people with a sedentary lifestyle.

Lap band hope for diabetes 
OVERWEIGHT people are resorting to surgery usually reserved for the severely obese for the sake of their health.
And some doctors are now so convinced by the success of lap band surgery in cutting the risk of diabetes they are calling for it to be available to anyone weighing 80kg or more.
Dr John Wentworth has led a study by Monash University's Centre for Obesity Research that found people who are overweight and had the surgery lost an average 11kg.
""For the vast majority of people, non-surgical intervention is not effective - it doesn't achieve sustained weight loss that can put diabetes into remission,"" he said.
A paper to be presented at a conference of diabetes specialists in Sydney this week shows lap band patients required significantly less medication to control their diabetes and most went into diabetes remission.
Those who didn't have the surgery but were put on a diet and exercise plan achieved a weight loss of just 2kg and required intense medication to manage their diabetes.
The average starting weight of the 51 patients who took part in the study was just 81kg. Guidelines say lap band surgery should only be performed on those with a BMI of 35 or above - or weighing more than 110-115kg.
Christine York, who weighed 90kg and had developed diabetes, volunteered for the trial nearly four years ago.
She lost about 25kg, plunged from a dress size of 18 to 12 and now weighs 63kg. Her diabetes is in remission.
""It made me realise you can change your life,"" she said. ""I even got married last year and wore a decent wedding dress, not a sack."" Her previous attempts at dieting shed just 4-5kg.
Dr Wentworth said it would be wrong to see his study as a business-building opportunity for obesity surgeons. He also cautioned that the research could not explain why the diabetes of only half the surgery patients went into remission. About 17,000 Australians a year undergo surgery to control their weight.

Half a million of us could have type 2 diabetes and not know it
Do you often find yourself thirsty? Tired? Any darkened spots on your skin, or a bruise that just won't seem to go away? You may have diabetes and not know it. Up to 500,000 Australians have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Another 2 million are on the cusp of developing the potentially deadly disease. One in three of those at risk will develop the disease over the next 10 years unless they take action. The number of people around the world with diabetes has quadrupled since 1980 from 108 million to 422 million in 2014, according to a new study published in The Lancet. The study found that diabetes has become more common among men than women. The ageing population helps explain the increase in western countries. Professor Majid Ezzati, from Imperial College London, said diabetes had become a ""defining issue for global public health"". ""Obesity is the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and our attempts to control rising rates of obesity have so far not proved successful.""

Cholesterol to fight diabetes
MELBOURNE researchers will artificially raise levels of ""good"" cholesterol in diabetics, in a first human trial aiming to stop patients with ""pre-diabetes"" progressing to the full-blown disease.
While the links between heart disease, stroke and cholesterol have long been known, researchers are beginning to discover that ""good"" HDL cholesterol may also protect against diabetes.
Almost a quarter of Australian adults have either diabetes or the lifestyle-related condition of impaired glucose metabolism known as ""pre-diabetes"".
Heart disease and stroke are the biggest complications of diabetes. The Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute has joined an international race to find a new ""good"" cholesterol-raising drug as the first treatment for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
The head of Baker IDI's Metabolic and Vascular Physiology Laboratory, Prof Bronwyn Kingwell, said diabetes upset the balance between the protective HDL particles and the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol particles. HDL particles scavenge the artery-clogging fats that LDL particles deposit.
The proof-of-concept study will use the experimental drug RVX-208 to raise HDL levels in 20 patients by just 5 to 10 per cent over four weeks.
Prof Kingwell said the drug worked by increasing production of high-quality ""good"" cholesterol. These newly created HDL particles may help improve glucose control for diabetics through their effects on pancreatic cells and muscle, which are the body's major sites of glucose utilisation.
This has the potential to prevent or delay the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes.
The study has been supported by a $500,000 National Health and Medical Research Council grant.

Fat males pass trait as far as grandkids
CARRYING extra weight not only affects a man's fertility, it could leave their daughters and grandsons with diabetes and make it harder for them to have children, new research has revealed.
Findings from the world-first study are adding to the growing body of evidence that a father's health at the time of conception can influence the overall health of not only their children, but also their grandchildren.
Previous studies have shown that obese fathers are more likely to have lower sperm counts and sperm DNA damage, their children are more likely to be overweight, and their partner is more likely to miscarry.
But researchers from the University of Adelaide have found the first evidence that paternal obesity at the time of conception directly affects the fertility of offspring.
Researchers fed male mice a high-fat diet for 10 weeks before they were mated with normal weight-controlled females.
The female mice born were at increased risk of being obese and developing diabetes. Their ovaries were also found to have been genetically altered.
And the grandsons of obese fathers did not dodge the genetic bullet. They were also more likely to develop diabetes and have their fertility affected.
Dr Michelle Lane, research fellow at the university's School of Paediatrics and Reproductive Health, said the findings could have significant implications for humans.
""There is clearly some inherited factor from obese fathers that directly impacts on the ovarian molecular profile of their female offspring affecting reproductive health,"" Dr Lane said.
""We have looked at eggs produced by these female offspring, and once fertilised, the resulting embryos grow slower than those in the control group. This is normally associated with reduced fertility."" Dr Lane said the research would continue - including analysing the sperm of obese humans later this year - to unlock the reasons why a father's weight could affect the health of multiple generations.
""We do know there is an increasing epidemic of obesity that's not explained, particularly in children,"" she said.
""Cholesterol is very important to cell membranes and sperm."" The findings were presented at the Fertility Society of Australia's annual scientific meeting.

Slim hope from hormone Trial hopes to find testosterone link to fighting the flab
BOOSTING testosterone levels in men could help fight the flab and prevent type 2 diabetes.
A $4.8 million world-first study by a team of Australian researchers will investigate whether the hormone supplements can help fight the obesity crisis.
Recruitment of up to 1500 men aged 50-74 from Victoria, NSW, South Australia and Western Australia is under way. The two Victorian trial sites are the Austin Hospital and Prince Henry's Institute, at Monash Medical Centre.
Prince Henry's Institute endocrinologist Dr Carolyn Allan said participants would be required to be in a pre-diabetic stage, in which their blood glucose was higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
Dr Allan said as women aged, they went through a significant, marked decline in oestrogen.
The effect of hormones on men as they aged was less defined. ""We know as men age they experience a 1-2 per cent decline in their testosterone levels, often as early as their 30s,"" Dr Allan said.
Men who were overweight or pre-diabetic also experienced a drop in testosterone. But those who maintained good health as they aged did not necessarily experience this decline.
Professor Gary Wittert, of the University of Adelaide's school of medicine, said lower testosterone could reduce the motivation to exercise and lead to a lack of sexual function. But studies have shown giving men testosterone reduces belly fat and increases muscle mass.
""If we can identify men who have big bellies, are predisposed to diabetes and have low testosterone, and treat them, then we could prevent them from going on to develop diabetes,"" Dr Allan said.
Half of the participants would receive testosterone injections once every three months and half would receive a placebo. All would be required to take part in a weight loss program
""We want to determine if there is a benefit to giving them testosterone over and above the weight loss,"" Dr Allan said.
The trial is financed by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Diabetes on trial
NEWBORN babies could help scientists pinpoint the triggers of type 1 diabetes. The biggest study of its kind in the southern hemisphere will investigate why prevalence of the auto-immune disease has doubled in the past two decades.
It is believed children are exposed to triggers in the environment for the disease as babies, or while they are still in the womb.
Royal Melbourne researchers are part of the national team investigating whether exposures during pregnancy - the mother's nutrition, diet or microbes - could explain why some babies develop the disease and others do not.
The 1600 babies, who have relatives with the auto-immune disease, will be examined over three years in a bid to find ways to prevent the disease.
In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system destroys pancreas cells that produce insulin, which regulates the conversion of sugars in food into energy.
The research will focus on islet autoimmunity, which is an underlying autoimmunity to insulin-producing cells, that can be detected in the blood stream before symptoms of type 1 diabetes start.
The national research team wants to determine the environmental factors that trigger it.
Victorian woman Kim Bush has enrolled her baby, Zachary, 10 months, in the trial at the RMH.
The type 1 diabetic suffered numerous diabetes-related complications during her pregnancies and lost three babies.
She is desperate to help researchers because she knows how taxing it can be on your life, relying on daily insulin injections and constant blood tests.
""The research is critical because it could lead to prevention or a cure,"" Mrs Bush said.
""I would just urge anyone to take part in this trial because it's vital not just for your children, but for your grandchildren and their grandchildren."" Royal Melbourne Hospital Diabetes and Endocrinology Director Professor Peter Colman said he believed that environmental exposures during pregnancy through to early childhood could be the key to understanding the development of the disease.
He said more than 122,000 Australians suffer from type 1 diabetes, but the incidence increases 3.2	 per cent a year.
Pregnant women from South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and NSW with a first-degree relative with the auto-immune disease are being recruited for the trial.
Newborn babies less than six months old are also eligible. To take part: endia.org.au or 9342 8641.
SEEKING IMMUNITY Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system mistakenly turning on itself, destroying beta cells in the pancreas and removing the body's ability to produce insulin Without insulin, the body literally starves as it cannot process food The study will investigate the relationship between genes and environmental exposures Suspected triggers include nutrition, exercise, weight gain, viral infections and micro-organisms in our bodies Source: ENDIA

Aussies dumb on diabetes
AUSTRALIANS are dangerously ignorant of the risks of type 2 diabetes, despite rates of the chronic disease being tipped to triple by 2031.
An Australian Medicines Industry report, out today, surveyed 5000 Australians aged 32-66 on their opinions on health and disease.
It found 90 per cent of those surveyed did not consider the condition to be a major health concern.
The report also found 42 per cent of respondents did not exercise regularly - a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Industry spokesman Dr Brendan Shaw said the report's findings showed Australians were indifferent about the chronic disease.
""There is a clear disconnect between our views on health, particularly in relation to weight and the implications of that in regard to serious and potentially life-threatening disease,"" Dr Shaw said.
He said while Australians were aware of the messages of healthy eating and exercise, the long-term consequences of obesity were not well understood.
""A staggering 65 per cent of all cardiovascular deaths occur in people with diabetes or pre-diabetes.""

Good news: As you savour your next glass of wine, you can do so in the knowledge it could be lowering your risk of diabetes.
A Danish study found that men and women who drank alcohol three to four times during the week had a 27 per cent and 32 per cent reduced risk, respectively, compared to those who drank less than one drink per week.
But not all alcohol is created equal, according to the researchers. While seven glasses of wine per week was associated with 25-30 per cent lower risk, a similar number of beers reduced diabetes risk in men only (21 per cent lower) and had no effect on women.
And it's not such good news for lovers of spirits - seven or more of those over a week actually increased diabetes risk in women by a whopping 83 per cent.

Bacteria on rescue ride for diabetes 
A MEDICINAL diet that boosts good bacteria in our gut may be the key to reducing the risk of type 1 diabetes, one of the most common chronic diseases in children.
For the first time, Monash University-led research has shown a special combination of fibre, which could be sprinkled on food, can stop mice developing diabetes.
Plans are underway to trial the fermentable fibres that promote gut health in humans with the hope of either preventing the auto-immune disease from developing or reducing reliance on medication.
The diet, developed by CSIRO and refined by the university, uses a combination of resistant starches that are broken down by gut bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids: acetate and butyrate.
These substances, known as metabolites, are emerging as a key part of keeping the immune system healthy.
""We think that metabolites have anti-inflammatory effects and they do remarkable things in every single major disease we look at: cardiovascular disease, food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma,"" the university's Professor Charles Mackay said.
Together with his colleague Dr Eliana Marino from the Biomedicine Discovery Institute he tested the diets in the laboratory. ""The amazing thing about this is that we gave these diets to mice after they developed diabetes, so all the immune processes were already in place, and we still managed to protect the mice from developing full-blown diabetes,"" he said.
""It would be awesome if what we found in mice holds true for humans."" It could prevent or reduce insulin dependency in children who have tested positive to an early sign of type 1 diabetes by stopping the islet cells in their pancreas being destroyed.
Although the starches used in the study are found in foods, Prof Mackay said it was unlikely the levels needed could be achieved through a healthy diet alone.
""We call our approach a medicinal food approach because it can't be replicated just by eating high amounts of fruit and vegetables,"" he said.
""It's a supplement that you could sprinkle on your food that would give you an enormous hit of acetate or butyrate or both.
""I think it could be a tremendous way to get our gut back to good health and prevent these inflammatory diseases."" While type 1 diabetes has a genetic basis, Prof Mackay believes our western diet, which lacks dietary fibre, could be behind increasing incidence of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and food allergies.

A nation of sick people Shock tests reveal health threat
MILLIONS of Australians have heart disease and diabetes but don't know it, according to the shock results of blood tests taken in a national health survey.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics uncovered Australia's hidden disease problems when it tested blood and urine samples from 11,000 people taking part in its regular health survey.
The results were a surprise for participants and health practitioners, uncovering serious undiagnosed health problems.
One in three Australians in the survey were found to have high cholesterol, but only one in 10 knew it.
The results of the blood tests showed three in four Australians aged over 45 had risk factors for heart disease and nearly half of those aged 18-45 had at least one risk factor for heart disease.
Almost one million Australians have been told they have diabetes, but going by the rates found in the survey another 231,000 have the disease but don't know it and a further 700,000 are at risk.
The blood tests showed one in 10 Australians have chronic kidney disease, and up to 12 per cent have liver problems.
Just over four in 100 Australians have anaemia, a condition that forces the heart to work harder to ensure muscles and organs get the oxygen they need.
Obese adults were five times more likely to have cholesterol problems, the survey found.
The Heart Foundation says the results show that Australia needs more routine checks to identify people at risk of heart attacks, strokes and chronic disease.
""In New Zealand, 60 per cent of the eligible population have had a heart and diabetes check in the past five years,"" foundation chief Dr Lyn Roberts said.
""Australia is a long way behind our neighbour, with some estimates showing only 5 per cent of Australians are getting a health check by their doctor.""
Diabetes Australia chief Greg Johnson says other studies have found the rate of undiagnosed diabetes was even higher and urged all Australians to have a blood glucose test once a year.
Those Australians who didn't know they had diabetes could also be developing kidney and eye problems and other complications as a result, he said.
Australian Medical Association chief Dr Steve Hambleton said every adult in Australia should know their cholesterol level and everyone should be assessed at the age of 45 and earlier if there is a family history.

Diabetics can eat dessert. Blueberry tart made with filo pastry to cut down fat. Cardamom yoghurt pudding and saffron pears. Granitas galore. Squeezed, frozen and scraped into a tall glass, they're just like eating a piece of fruit - only more exciting.
The sweet treats are the clincher for anyone monitoring their diet in a glamorous diabetes-friendly cookbook - At My Table - by St Vincent's Hospital Diabetes Centre in Sydney, with recipes from 60 celebrated Australian chefs. Maggie Beer is in the line-up with haloumi and citrus lentils; so are the likes of Stephanie Alexander, Neil Perry, Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston, Luke Mangan and Kylie Kwong.
""The response was unbelievable,"" co-editor Amanda Bilson said. ""We ended up with a huge contribution from chefs around the country, not just Sydney, and the recipes fell into place. Janni Kyritsis has done most of the desserts and I think they're the biggest selling point of the book because diabetics often struggle with weight problems and have to watch both fat and carbohydrate content.""
Kyritsis, formerly of MG Garage in Surry Hills, has type 2 diabetes and puts the emphasis on light desserts, so no puff pastry, rich ice-creams, or buttery brioche. All are easy with ingredients that can be found in any grocery store.
The book is among a swag out this year targeting healthy eating, the latest - The CSIRO and Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute's Diabetes Recipe Book - released yesterday as a companion to their popular The CSIRO and Baker IDI Diabetes and Lifestyle Plan.
Bilson was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 15 after developing an insatiable thirst, ""strange"" lethargy and an inability to concentrate after moving to a new school to start studying for her A levels in the UK.
""In 1968 it was treated as a disease,"" she said. ""I was the fourth of six children and the only one to have it then, so it came as a bit of a shock to Mum. It was a seriously life-changing event for me. What you were told in those days was that you couldn't eat sugar and you had to count every carbohydrate. I'm still very resistant to tasting sweet things because I've come from the old school where sugar was a forbidden food.
""Fortunately, diabetes is not treated like that anymore. You're told how to manage it, so you can go to a birthday party and eat a piece of cake, but you just need to give yourself more insulin. As a teenager I found it hard, but I adjusted to it fairly easily and have made the condition my friend, rather than my enemy. You can still lead a very full life.""
Thank goodness she married chef Tony Bilson, whose mud crab with champagne sauce recipe has only 1g of carbs.
About 1.5 million Australians have diabetes and nearly 100,000 developed it in the past year. Diabetes Australia describes the condition as a ""21st century pandemic affecting 370 million worldwide"", with chief executive Professor Greg Johnson saying that on current trends it will become the ""Number 1 burden of disease in Australia in the next five years"".
""About 85 per cent of people with diabetes in Australia have type 2, and the other 15 per cent have type 1,"" the Diabetes Centre's clinical dietitian Melissa Armstrong said. ""The reasons are multifactorial, including the ageing population, the fact we're getting fatter and our changing ethnicity. We have more people from countries with a genetic predisposition to type 2, which might be triggered by a change of lifestyle here.""
She has reviewed all the recipes in the book and included tips on reducing fat, sugar and carbs for anyone watching their weight, blood glucose levels or cholesterol. Each one also has basic nutrition information.
""I wanted a cookbook that everyone could enjoy,"" Bilson said. ""My whole premise is that being a diabetic should not stop you from eating really beautiful food. Most of the recipes are user-friendly and accessible. ""What diabetics need to remember is that bread, fruit, pastries and cereals all add to the carbohydrate load, so you have to count them all the time. If I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch, that's 25g of carbs, and for that 25g of carbs, I'll need so many units of insulin. You need to be that calculating, otherwise you'll end up with your blood sugar being too high if you eat something and don't count it, or, just as bad, too low, and you end up having a hypo.""
Money raised from sales of the cookbook will go directly towards funding services provided by staff for patients, their families and carers at the St Vincent's Hospital Diabetes Centre.

Too much sleep bad for health
EVERYONE knows that getting too little sleep can be bad for your health, but new research suggests having a regular lie in could be even worse.
Too little sleep and too much shut-eye both increase the risk of serious illnesses including diabetes, new research suggests.
A study of more than 50,000 people found those who get too much or too little sleep are more likely to develop a range of physical and psychological conditions including coronary heart disease, diabetes, anxiety and obesity.
People who struggle to sleep for more than six hours a night are at greater risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity and mental illness.
On the other hand, scientists claim sleeping for too long carries the same risks as reduced sleep, although the American Academy of Sleep Medicine study found the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes was even higher among people who sleep for a long time.
Getting the right amount of sleep each night reduces the risk of developing these diseases and can help those who already suffer with health problems common among the over 45s.
Sleep expert Dr Safwan Badr said when and how you sleep is just as important as diet and exercise.
""It's critical that adults aim for seven to nine hours of sleep each night to receive the health benefits, but this is especially true for those battling a chronic condition,"" he said.
Dr Badr said sleep apnoea and insomnia interfered with a person's ability to sleep.
""If you are diagnosed with a sleep illness, treating it could significantly improve disease symptoms and your quality of life,"" he said.

EXERCISE can turn bad white fat into its healthier, calorie-burning brown version, and may help to keep diabetes at bay, according to research. Men who trained for 12weeks on an exercise bicycle showed a browning of their subcutaneous white adipose tissue in a study presented at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Chicago. In a separate study on mice, brown fat was linked with better glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, suggesting the substance may play a role in preventing diabetes. The results build on earlier studies showing that brown fat, previously thought to be active only in babies and children, contains calorie-burning properties and may help protect against weight gain. The study suggests exercise is beneficial even if it does not result in weight loss, the research shows.

Blood-pressure treatments candesartan, used by 257,000 patients, will increase by $2.06 a script, and amlodipine, used by 380,000 patients, by $3.31 a script.
Half the medicines on the nation's subsidy scheme will rise in price, the Health Department has revealed.
The price rises follow a new $3.49 handling fee paid to chemists, which replaces a 15 per cent mark-up, under a new five-year pharmacy agreement signed last week.
It means any medicine that costs general consumers less than $36 could rise in price when chemists pass on the new charge. Taxpayers pick up the bill when concessional patients such as pensioners buy the medicines. Health Minister Sussan Ley has defended the change, saying it is needed to keep pharmacies viable after they lost 16 per cent of their dispensing income when medicine prices fell under price disclosure.

Millions at risk as deadly diabetes rates explode
Up to 500,000 Australians have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes.
Another 2 million are on the cusp of developing the potentially deadly disease. One in three of those at risk will develop the disease over the next 10 years unless they take action.
The number of people around the world with diabetes has quadrupled since 1980 from 108 million to 422 million in 2014, according to a new study published in UK medical journal The Lancet.
The study found that diabetes has become more common among men than women.
The ageing population helps explain the increase in western countries. But the incidence of diabetes has risen significantly in low and middle-income countries including China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt and Mexico.
Professor Majid Ezzati, from Imperial College London, a senior author of the study, said diabetes had become a ""defining issue for global public health"".
""Obesity is the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and our attempts to control rising rates of obesity have so far not proved successful.""
Stephen Colagiuri, Professor of Metabolic Health and director of the University of Sydney's Boden Institute, says about 1.2 million Australians have diabetes which has been diagnosed - 10 per cent with type 1 diabetes and 90 per cent with type 2.
Apart from obesity, other risk factors include having a family history of diabetes, or having had short-term diabetes.
Professor Colagiuri is also co-director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre on Physical Activity, Nutrition and Obesity, which also released new data on Thursday showing that in some regions only 40 per cent of countries have ready access to insulin. The first WHO global report on diabetes shows in 2012 alone, diabetes caused 1.5 million deaths and its complications can lead to heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and lower limb amputation.
The rate of diabetes in Aboriginal people was three times as high than in non-Indigenous people. The rate of kidney disease is up to 10 times greater. ""There seems to be a mental block with taking action to preventing preventable diabetes deaths,"" Professor Colagiuri said.
He was part of a team that provided advice on the development of a national diabetes strategy released in November and which the federal government is in charge of implementing.
Among strategies he supported were the need for legislation, regulation and potentially a tax on sugar.

Green tea offers diabetes hope
THE consumption of green tea prevents rats from getting diabetes, a PhD student at Hobart's Menzies Research Institute has found.
Helena Ng said rats had been fed an unhealthy diet that normally led to the early stages of diabetes, but not when the diet was accompanied by green tea.
She said before she could find out if the popular Asian beverage also provided a shield against the disease in humans, she needed to find a way to get people to consume it in large quantities.
""Most locals don't like green tea,"" Ms Ng said.
She said it would be harder still to persuade Tasmanians to drink the required 200 cups a day.
""To put it in capsules or tablets - that is likely to be the next step,"" she said.
Ms Ng said, instead of stuffing tea leaves into tablets, she was hoping she could include just the green tea components that were not found in the more familiar black teas.
""We can do human trials as soon as we can get a way of administering it,"" she said.
Ms Ng said her exciting discovery in rats was made possible by a new test that detects early signs of diabetes.
She said green tea, if proven, could become a welcome alternative to existing anti-diabetes medications, which had side-effects.
Ms Ng said, so far, her evidence had suggested that green tea could prevent, but not cure, diabetes.
The tea is already well known for its anti-cancer properties.

Bright idea could win William a trip to NASA
It may be a typical incentive for a 10-year old, but William Grame's desire to get out of trouble has led to an invention that could win him the innovation trip of a lifetime, including a visit to NASA Kennedy Space Centre in the United States. William, 10, who has been a type- 1 diabetic for three years, pricks his finger to test his blood sugar levels up to 10 times per day. This requires the use of a new test strip each time, and their disposal was becoming a problem. ""The blood test strips are little and fiddly, I get in trouble for leaving them in the test kit or lying around the house,"" William said. The budding inventor from St Edmund's College designed the blood test strip disposal unit using a 3D printer and entered his invention into Origin's littleBIGidea competition, a national competition that aims to foster creativity and innovation in young students. The disposal unit is small and lightweight and has been measured to fit any diabetes kit. Best of all, it has been designed so used blood test strips can be fed into the disposal unit directly without being touched. ""I was particularly impressed with the concept of grabbing the strip, teachers and nurses help look after type-1 diabetics in day school, and of course they can't touch bloody strips,"" William's mother Elizabeth said. Origin Executive general manager Phil Craig said he is looking forward to seeing lots of 'outside-the-box' thinking from young Australians in Canberra and across the country. ""It's inspiring to see the next generation of innovators coming up with ideas like William's and demonstrating the power of imaginative thinking."" William's mum couldn't be prouder. ""It's very exciting, and amazing that a 10-year-old has thought of this idea. If you talk to any diabetic, they'll tell you that they have the things lying around everywhere... we think it has real potential,"" she said. William is currently getting 15 of the disposal units printed, and selling them for $3 each under his company Diabetes Domination. Although winning the grand prize will mean he can visit NASA, William would be happy just to be a finalist, who will all receive $1000 each. ""I would give 15per cent to Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and... spend the rest starting a business,"" William said.

Jones acts to head off diabetes 
RADIO shock jock Alan Jones has revealed he was a ""breath away"" from developing diabetes and has dropped weight to stave off the disease.
The broadcaster took to the airwaves yesterday morning to make the shock announcement that he is among an ""epidemic"" of pre-diabetic Australians at risk of developing the debilitating disease.
Jones, who said he doesn't have a sweet tooth, was fatigued and piling on weight before a doctor diagnosed him as insulin resistant.

Breakthrough tipping scales
AFTER a lifetime of looking after other people as a paramedic for St John Ambulance, retirement encouraged Stephen Peer to finally start looking after himself.
The 68-year-old Alice Springs man has type 2 diabetes and had struggled with losing weight to help his condition.
But after finding a breakthrough new treatment, now available in Darwin, he has lost a massive 31kg since May last year and has drastically reduced his daily dose of insulin.
The EndoBarrier intestinal liner is placed via the mouth, using a small tube. EndoBarrier Therapy doesn't make any changes to the stomach, unlike other weight-loss surgery options, and is completely reversible.
It uses cutting-edge technology and changes the way your body responds to food by causing the release of hormones.
With significantly higher rates of type 2 diabetes than anywhere else in Australia, the condition's burden on the Territory health system is huge.
Before the procedure, Mr Peer tipped the scales at 133.7kg.
""When I went from working to retirement I was at the wrong end of the scales,"" he said. ""My goal is eventually to come down to 95kg."" The doctor who performed Mr Peer's procedure, Dr Justin Bessell of Innovations Healthcare, said the EndoBarrier was a real game changer in treating obesity-related diseases. ""90 per cent of patients get back to a normal level of diabetic treatment and in nine months there is generally a 20 per cent reduction in weight,"" he said.
For Mr Peer, a father of three and grandad of six, the best thing is having more energy. ""It's made a big difference to my lifestyle, I'm now much more active,"" he said.

Storing hope for blood brothers
CHLOE Docking developed type 1 diabetes at the age of eight and has endured a lifetime of insulin injections.
Now aged 30, she wants to protect her young sons Jaxon, 4, and Izzak, 2, from the same fate.
""Because I have it, there's a chance they could end up with type 1 diabetes as well,"" she said.
She has registered them in a world-first Australian study that aims to prevent type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children.
Paediatric endocrinologist at the Children's Hospital Westmead in Sydney, Professor Maria Craig, said the study was looking at reinfusing stored cord blood into a child's system at the first sign of T1D in the hope it would reset the recipient's immune system.
Cord blood is the blood that remains in the placenta and in the attached umbilical cord after childbirth.
The study is recruiting participants aged between one and 14 whose relatives have T1D and who have stored cord blood. They are also recruiting families who are expecting a baby and planning cord blood storage.
Mrs Docking, of Loxton, said she made the decision to store her children's cord blood because the research could prevent a lifetime of injections or being on an insulin pump for her boys.
Cord blood and tissue banking has cost the family thousands of dollars - about $4000 for Jaxon and $200 a month for Izzak - but they feel the investment is worthwhile.

$27m to counter disease
QUEENSLANDERS vulnerable to deadly chronic conditions such as diabetes and stroke will be put through six-month intensive programs by the State Government to reboot their health.
The Palaszczuk Government will today announce $27	 million in funding over four years in a major ""counter- attack"" to the increasing scourge of type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions.
The funding will go to Diabetes Queensland to deliver a Health for Life! program.
Health Minister Cameron Dick said under the program eligible people would be offered free health risk assessments and be part of a structured six-month ""lifestyle modification program"", including health coaching, group programs and online support.
The program will target people aged 45 and over, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 18 and over, and people living with a pre-existing condition that puts them at a high risk of developing a chronic disease.
It will be up to GPs, primary healthcare workers and hospitals to identify eligible Queenslanders and refer them to the program.
""Helping people living in rural and remote locations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds will also be a priority,"" Mr Dick said.
He said preventable factors such as poor diets, lack of exercise, being overweight, high blood pressure and high cholesterol were putting Queenslanders at risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and lifestyle-related cancers.
""The reality is, type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed in 60 per cent of cases by healthy eating and a more active lifestyle,"" Mr Dick said.
About 390,000 Queenslanders have diabetes or are at risk of developing it, with numbers likely to rise as obesity rates increase.
""A person with type 2 diabetes can cost the health system about $10,000 a year, and the impact on productivity in Queensland can amount to as much as $1.1 billion a year."" Diabetes Queensland CEO Michelle Trute said the investment would be a ""serious counter-attack"" against type 2 diabetes and chronic disease.
""If we don't stem the tide, the human suffering and economic costs will overwhelm our health system, so it is vital we help as many Queenslanders as possible."" Today marks the start of National Diabetes Week.

Diabetes medicine shortage
TYPE 2 diabetics are being urged to see their GP following a sudden national shortage of the most commonly prescribed drug for the condition.
Manufacturing problems overseas have led to the shortage of metformin, which is sold here as Diabex and Diaformin.
Major pharmacy chains in Adelaide, including some Chemist Warehouse and National Pharmacies outlets, are telling customers they have run out of the drug. The slow release drug helps make the insulin that type 2 diabetics produce more effective.
A spokesman for Diabetes Australia said the shortage was expected to be short term, adding: ""We advise people who are concerned to see their doctor."" Diabetes Australia estimates that 1.7 million Australians have diabetes - including those yet to be diagnosed - and 85 per cent of cases are type 2.
Type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition in which the body becomes resistant to the normal effects of insulin and/or gradually loses the capacity to produce enough insulin in the pancreas. Its cause is unknown but it is associated with lifestyle risk factors and has strong genetic risk factors.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has been advised of the drug shortage and is in contact with pharmaceutical company Alphapharm to clarify the issue.
The TGA notes it is not uncommon for there to be temporary shortages of medicines.
Reasons can include disruption to manufacturing processes, unavailability of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, changes in product formulation or manufacturer, commercial decisions and unexpected increases in demand resulting from disease outbreak or new clinical practice.
A TGA spokeswoman said the administration had been advised by Alphapharm that the 1000mg extended release Diabex XR and Diaformin XR had batch releases in April and there should not be a shortage of either product, despite some local pharmacies not having any.
""In some cases, it does take time for products to make their way through the supply chain and this may be creating the perception of a shortage,"" the spokeswoman said.
""Alphapharm has advised that they anticipate the 500mg extended release of Diabex XR and Diaformin XR will be back on the market by May 31, 2016."" Worried diabetics calling Diabetes Australia state branches about the drug shortage are being advised to see their GPs about appropriate alternative medication.
The TGA advises that alternative extended release products containing metformin hydrochloride include: APO-METFORMIN XR 500mg and 1000mg modified release tablet blister packs; CHEMMART metformin XR 500mg modified release tablet blister pack, and TERRY White Chemists metformin XR 500mg modified release tablet blister pack.

Skim milk a fat lot of good in diabetes stakes
THERE'S good news for those who love full-fat milk: turns out it's healthier than skim milk.
That's the finding of a new study published in the journal Circulation that suggests low-fat dairy puts you at greater risk of developing diabetes.
The researchers came to that conclusion after analysing the blood results of 3333 adults aged between 30 and 75 taken over 15 years.
Making adjustments to take into account the role of the individual's weight, the researchers found that people who had higher levels of three different by-products of full-fat dairy had an average 46 per cent lower risk of developing diabetes.
And they found that, independent of weight gain, the connection between full-fat dairy intake and lower diabetes risk remained strong.
""There is no prospective human evidence that people who eat low-fat dairy do better than people who eat whole-fat dairy,"" study leader Dr Dariush Mozaffarian said.
It's still unclear exactly how full-fat dairy helps lower diabetes, but there's speculation that it helps regulate glucose and insulin in the body. High-fat foods also keep you full longer than sugary or high-carb foods, which leads to lower overall consumption of calories.

Diabetes link raises cancer epidemic fear
PEOPLE with diabetes have up to a 70 per cent increased risk of developing certain cancers, a study has shown.
With more than 260 new cases of Type 1 and 2 diabetes added to Australia's national diabetes registry every day, experts say the findings should mean cancer screening is part of standard diabetes treatment to help prevent a future cancer epidemic.
Baker IDI researchers in Melbourne, led by PhD student Jessica Harding, matched about 1 million people on the National Diabetes Service Scheme to national cancer and death registries, comparing this to death rates and cancer incidence of the general population without diabetes.
The study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, found both types of diabetes put people at ""excess risk of incidence and mortality"" overall and for specific cancers.
Type 2 diabetes put people at greater risk of most cancers, but specifically increased the risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia by 60-70 per cent, gall bladder cancer by 50-58 per cent and kidney and bladder cancers by 20-70 per cent.
Women with Type 1 cancer had an 80 per cent higher risk of brain cancer and 50 per cent higher risk of endometrial cancer. Oesophageal cancer risk rose by 60 per cent for men.
Baker IDI unit head of diabetes and population health, Associate Professor Dianna Magliano said there had been emerging evidence over the past decade of a link between diabetes and cancer.
""We think that high glucose facilitates the growth of cancer cells,"" Prof Magliano said.
""The pancreas and liver are highly metabolic, they're highly active organs. ""But we don't really know the reasons."" With diabetes and cancer rates increasing, screening was vital, Prof Magliano said.
""Potentially as time goes on, as more people have diabetes, they're going to survive their renal disease, cardiovascular disease, which we've learnt to treat quite well with statins and antihypertensive drugs,"" she said.
""But now they're living long enough to develop cancer. It's probably going to become another epidemic that will put pressure on the health system."" The researchers will now match the diabetes registry with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, to help determine if particular drugs are contributing to people developing cancer. ""There is also some evidence that some diabetes treatments, like some insulins, increase the risk of cancer,"" she said.

Big steps forward but still a way to go
AUSTRALIAN DIABETES COUNCIL - 75 YEARS
Living with the disease is tough, but advances are making it easier, writes Clive Hopkins.
More than 1 million people in Australia have been diagnosed with diabetes, with another diagnosed every five minutes. As part of the recent Diabetes Awareness Week, the Australian Diabetes Council is encouraging all Australians to consider if they are at risk.
Angela Blair is the council's manager (regions) and has 34 years' experience in diabetes education. For those living with the disease, she details some of the recent advances in drugs and delivery systems.
""Insulin pumps for type-1 diabetes are a programmable and more efficient drug-delivery system, which more closely mimics the way a functional pancreas works,"" she says. ""This means less risk of low blood-glucose levels, allowing for more flexible eating and more varied activities.""
Insulin pumps have been around for 30 years, but more Australians are using them because they are available through the National Diabetes Services Scheme.
Continuous glucose monitors are becoming more prevalent, giving wearers more accurate information to program into their pump. So-called ""smart meters"" can even feed this information into mobile phones.
Insulin pens can remind users of the last time they had insulin - very important for type-1 patients who could have to take it as often as six times a day.
""Thirty years ago, for those with type-2 diabetes, there were two basic medications,"" Blair says. ""Now there are five... categories. All work on enhancing... insulin production, but are more targeted at specific patient needs.""
Last month, Australian doctors and researchers published the results of a clinical trial of great interest to those living with type-1 diabetes. In the trial, insulin-producing cells from a donor were transplanted into the liver of a recipient with hypoglycaemic unawareness - a severe condition in which patients don't experience the usual symptoms of low blood-glucose levels.
While research continues into the long-term effects, it does hold out the possibility of a life free from insulin injections.
Danish diabetes researcher Dr Stig Pramming was in Sydney recently speaking at the Diabetes Awareness Week Sustainability Forum. A former professor of diabetes at Oxford University, Pramming spoke of the European experience.
""We all need to find better and cheaper ways to support people with chronic diseases like diabetes,"" he says. ""All European countries are experimenting with getting 'more out of less', and better-quality outcomes.""
Pramming cites the example of Bulgaria, where, after the collapse of communism, the country allowed the market to determine all healthcare decisions, with disastrous consequences.
In 2011, in a world first, patient organisations came together in a single national body to collaborate with the government and work towards creating more effective, patient-oriented healthcare.
The case of the Netherlands has swung in the other direction, removing politicians from the healthcare equation about four years ago. ""This works because the driver for the system is the consumer and is completely transparent in a way that an entirely state-funded system is not,"" Pramming says.
Another interesting case is that of Finland, which, for reasons unknown, has the highest prevalence of type-1 diabetes in the world.
Since 2000, the Finnish Diabetic Association has been running a prevention program for people at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The program has been endorsed by the government but funded by the gambling industry.
""This has been tremendously successful, preventing 60 per cent of type-2 diabetes nationwide, where previously there had been no prevention. And there are signs of decreasing costs, too.""
Pramming sees this kind of consumer-led movement for improved healthcare as a model the whole world could learn from.
""Australia has sometimes a little of an inferiority complex, but you've actually been ahead of the curve in terms of diabetes planning, looking at obesity as a result of modern lifestyles, trying to find ways of preventing the disease, and intervening at a community level.""
A disorder that conforms to type
Diabetes is a condition in which there is too much glucose in the blood. It occurs when the body doesn't make enough insulin, which glucose needs to enter body cells.
Type-1 diabetes usually occurs in childhood or young adulthood. Although its exact cause is unknown, it is not the result of lifestyle factors. It requires lifelong daily injections of insulin.
Type-2 usually occurs in adults over 45, although younger people are being diagnosed. Risk factors include family history, weight, and ethnic background. Treatment involves tablets or insulin injections, although reducing weight and increasing exercise can reduce or even eliminate the need for medication.
Gestational diabetes affects some women during pregnancy, although symptoms usually disappear after birth.

She is part of a team that has collected detailed information on a baseline cohort of 1125 women and their babies.
Ms Whitbread said she hoped research findings would be released soon. ""Pregnant women are motivated... if you can normalise the intra-uterine environment you can dramatically reduce the likelihood of a child developing diabetes,"" she said.
""You get a short-term outcome ? hopefully a healthy baby ? and create lifestyle changes women can bring back to their families.
""We have been working closely with health professionals to get the best evidence into practice."" Ms Whitbread specialised in diabetes in 1999 and was part of a team that managed to halve diabetic foot disease amputations in the NT over three years.

ASK THE NATUROPATH...
Q A blood test has shown that I have high insulin levels. My doctor says it's a sign I have insulin resistance and could be heading towards type 2 diabetes. What does insulin do? And what can I do to reduce it?
A Insulin is a hormone made by beta cells, which are found in the romantic-sounding but rather mundane Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It helps to maintain the blood's glucose levels by controlling the glucose channels and allowing it to cross cell membranes to be used for energy.
Beta cells are destroyed in type 1 diabetes, and without them insulin can't be created. In these cases, insulin needs to be injected into the body.
In the early stages of type 2 diabetes (the most common form), the cells start to resist the hormone's instruction to allow glucose to enter cells, causing blood sugar levels to rise - this is insulin resistance.
Causes of insulin resistance As well as being linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is also associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, sleep apnoea, high blood pressure and some cancers.
Resistance can be inherited, however, lifestyle factors play an enormous role in causing it, with inactivity and overeating the biggest concerns. Other risk factors include high blood sugar levels, elevated triglycerides (blood fat), ageing and taking certain medications.
herbs and minerals that help Natural ways to lower blood glucose and reduce insulin resistance include herbs such as goat's rue, gymnema, cinnamon, Panax (Korean) ginseng and fenugreek.
Also try supplements of chromium, zinc, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D, fish oil, alpha-lipoic acid and B-complex vitamins.
easy lifestyle changes Muscle contraction improves the uptake of glucose by cells. Muscles contract when you exercise, and 30 minutes daily has been shown to decrease insulin resistance.
Adding certain foods to your daily diet can assist in your body's blood-sugar regulation. Try including legumes, oats, cinnamon (add a teaspoon to your cereal or smoothie), fenugreek, blueberries and bitter melon (bitter gourd). Studies have also shown that soluble fibre enhances insulin sensitivity, as well as slowing the release of sugar into the bloodstream.
Good sources of soluble fibre are fruit, vegetables, legumes, oats, psyllium husks, chia seeds, nuts and seeds.
Avoid eating sugar and refined flour products such as cakes and white bread.
Having a glass of wine with a meal has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.

Wake-up call for the high-protein brigade
AN Australian study concluding that a high protein, low-carbohydrate diet reduces lifespan and increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease should be of great concern to the fitness industry, where a large proportion of people believe a diet dominated by protein shakes or bars leads to lean muscle mass and rapid weight loss.
Timmy Naidoo, director of Sydney supplement store Body Dynamix, has seen how the myth that carbohydrates are evil has infiltrated the health and fitness community.
""About 60 to 70 per cent of first-time bodybuilders and fitness models come to me and confess they consume about three protein shakes a day and neglect a well-balanced meal,"" says Naidoo, who has a diploma in personal training and nutrition.
""Young people think the more protein shakes the better, however too many shakes slows down the metabolism. A well-balanced diet of carbs, protein and fats provides adequate nutrients; a carefully monitored supplements program, adequate rest and a structured fitness regime will achieve results."" As a personal trainer and two-time International Natural Bodybuilding Association finalist for NSW, I've advised my predominantly corporate female clients against relying on meal replacement shakes, which are unsustainable in the long term and should only be used as a last resort.
This appears to be supported by the study at the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre in which mice were fed a variety of 25 diets. Researchers examined the effects of protein, fat and carbohydrate on energy intake, metabolic health, ageing and longevity.
The research, published in the journal Cell Metabolism in March, found that a high protein, low-carbohydrate diet resulted in less body fat and food intake but also reduced lifespan and raised the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Researchers believe these results will apply to humans.
The study also found that, in contrast, a high carbohydrate, low-protein diet resulted in more body fat but a longer lifespan and less risk of diabetes and heart disease.
A low protein, high-fat diet provided the worst health outcomes. The short-term side effects of a high protein, low-carbohydrate diet include constipation, vitamin deficiency, a poor immune system, gastrointestinal upsets and high intake of saturated fats.
This can lead to serious long-term problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Ketosis (the state in which the body uses fat for energy) can occur when the body is extremely low in carbs, eventually resulting in starvation and muscle wastage.
Ameer Ibrahim, FIFA sports medicine instructor for the Asian Football Confederation, says it's difficult for the body to ingest large volumes of protein year after year.
""Asian countries like Korea and Japan have a high incidence of cancer of the gut due to their high-protein diet of fish and cured meat,"" Ibrahim says.
""I'm also concerned that gym-goers here consume too much protein. ""Protein is important to repair muscles after lifting weights and putting on size, but the dosage of is paramount: the body requires 2.5g of protein daily per kilogram of body weight."" Ibrahim, who is also chief medical officer for the Sydney Roosters and Sydney FC, agrees with researchers who say a diet that has moderate amounts of high-quality protein (about 15 to 20 per cent of total calorie intake) and is relatively low in fat and high in good-quality complex carbohydrates will yield the best metabolic health and prospects for longevity.
""This is a good all-year round strategy for optimum health,"" he says. If you want to build lean muscle, South Sydney Rabbitohs team dietitian Caitlin Reid says you need a good weights program and a nutrition plan that meets your training goals.
""Having a positive energy balance creates the right environment to gain muscle and you need to time your nutrient intake around your training - focusing on protein and carbohydrates immediately after exercise,"" she says. ""Consume small hits of protein throughout the day: 25g of protein six times per day. You can get this through good-quality protein sources like lean red meat, skinless chicken, fish and dairy products.""

Diabetes implant may lead to cure
RESEARCHERS are developing an implantable ""SIM card"" they believe will eventually lead to a universal effective cure for type 1 diabetes.
The card would be implanted in diabetic children and would contain insulin-producing cell islets - harvested from donor pancreases - ending the need for daily injections and the risk of dangerous hypoglycaemic episodes.
Transplanted islets already are used successfully, but side effects from anti-rejection drugs means only people who suffer extreme cases of ""hypo"" episodes qualify for the present system, in which the islets are diffused into the recipient's liver, sometimes taking multiple procedures.
Only about 30 such procedures have been carried out in Australia. These include people who no longer need daily insulin injections after, in some cases, 40 years of relying on needles. About 140,000 Australians have type 1 diabetes.
A $3.3 million Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation grant of Federal Government money this month will enable researchers to continue work towards training ""super islets"" to be capable of fending off a recipient's natural immune reaction to a foreign body.
This would end the need for immunosuppression drugs, and pave the way for islet transplants to be available to virtually anyone with type 1 diabetes, rather than just the most extreme cases where the benefits outweigh the risk of drugs.
The grant will support research at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and University of Adelaide in conjunction with sites in Sydney and Melbourne.
RAH head of renal transplantation Professor Toby Coates, one of the study investigators, said the aim was to allow people to have the islet transplants without the risk of them also needing anti-rejection drugs.
""We are looking at a protocol of transplanting the islets without using drugs, partly based on modifying the islets themselves,"" he said. Prof Coates said the drug-free approach built on more than a decade of work.

Insulin on your phone
MELBOURNE researchers are testing the use of a mobile phone device that delivers insulin in a world-first study they hope will prevent Type 1 diabetics dying in their sleep.
St Vincent's Hospital is leading the clinical trial of an ""artificial pancreas"" that will see 12 Victorian adults and 12 Western Australian children have an android phone take over monitoring of their insulin needs, removing the need for finger prick checks.
In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops making the chemical insulin, which means the body cannot turn glucose into energy.
Diabetics manually measure their blood glucose levels via a finger prick or a continuous glucose monitor, at least four times a day, to determine how much insulin they need.
But St Vincent's Hospital endocrinologist Associate Professor David O'Neal said this was a ""very rough match"".
The study, funded by Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, also involves Royal Melbourne Hospital, The Alfred hospital, University of Melbourne, University of Sydney and Deakin University.
Diabetics can lose consciousness without knowing their blood sugar levels have dropped and deaths can occur overnight.
The study's closed-loop system includes an android phone controller, a glucose sensor under the skin that instructs an insulin pump every five minutes as to how much of the hormone to dispense.
Study subject Cath Stephensen said her blood sugar levels were now regulated better than they ever had been since she was diagnosed at age 25. ""I'm less tired, more mentally alert and I don't feel sick all the time,"" she said.

Diabetes rate 'shameful'
PARENTS of Australian children suffering from type 2 diabetes should wear the blame for their poor health, an international expert says.
The president of the International Diabetes Federation, Sir Michael Hirst, has told the National Press Club in Canberra that the plight of these children is a national shame.
Warning that diabetes has become a ""mammoth peacetime catastrophe"", he said that where previously people were losing their limbs to landmines, now they are losing them to diabetes.
About 962 Australians aged under 20 have diabetes; a further 358 have gestational diabetes; and another 29,700 Australians aged under 39 have the disease.
""That is a function the lifestyle, of the diet, of the lack of exercise and, I have to say, of parental responsibility as well,"" Sir Michael said.
""There is no point beating around the bush. This is a figure that I find personally quite shameful in any country where young people are succumbing to diabetes.""
More than 1.5 million Australians have type 2 diabetes, another 280 cases are diagnosed every day and almost two million people have high blood glucose levels and are in a pre-diabetic state.
Type 2 diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas produces some, but not enough, insulin.
The risk of type 2 diabetes is increased by high blood pressure, being overweight or obese, doing insufficient physical activity or having a poor diet. It will become Australia's most prevalent disease within five years.
Sufferers risk complications including kidney failure, blindness and limb amputation.
Chief executive of Diabetes Australia Greg Johnson told the Press Club diabetes was costing Australia $14.6 billion a year.
The lack of a national strategy to deal with it meant in the past 10 years 20,000 people had amputations and 10,000 went blind as a result of complications from diabetes.
Another 80,000 had heart attacks, 40,000 had strokes and 25,000 had kidney failure and needed dialysis.
Diabetes Australia yesterday launched a five-point strategy it wants politicians of both sides of politics to adopt after the 2013 election.

Health fears as the number of obese expectant mothers on the rise
The number of overweight, expectant mothers has risen dramatically, with more women and babies at risk of serious health issues, a major insurer has warned. Nearly 60 per cent of pregnant Australians are obese or overweight, according to the Medibank Better Health Index, which compares with 49 per cent in 2008. Medical director for Medibank Kevin Cheng said being overweight carried a number of risks, including a greater risk of complications during birth, a greater risk of developing a form of diabetes during pregnancy, as well as longer term issues. ""Obesity can cause complications for both mother and infant during pregnancy, labour, and after the birth,"" he said. ""If you're in the overweight category, with a BMI of between 25 and 30, and the obese category, which is a BMI of over 30, those are escalating points of increased risk. ""There's also a risk of getting gestational diabetes during pregnancy, associated with larger babies,"" he said.
 Medibank member data shows the number of births in which gestational diabetes was a factor has doubled between 2008 and 2015, in line with the survey results, Dr Cheng said. Obesity Policy Coalition executive manager Jane Martin said women who were overweight had twice the risk of gestational diabetes, and for obese women that risk was eight times more than for a person of a healthy weight.

No fizz for kids
Children who drink more than one can of soft drink a day are more likely to succumb to type 2 diabetes, heart disease or a stroke, according to a new study.
The Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, in Perth, has followed more than 1400 teenagers as part of its ongoing long-term Raine Study into children's health.
The latest results, revealed in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed more than one standard can of fizzy, sugary drink resulted in lower levels of ""good"" cholesterol and higher levels of ""bad"" triglyceride in the blood - regardless of whether they were overweight. This meant those teens were at higher risk of cardio-metabolic disease.
""It is already widely accepted that a high consumption of sugary drinks increases obesity risk in young people,"" lead researcher and UWA adjunct senior research fellow Gina Ambrosini says. ""What is important about this study is that excessive sugary drink consumption appears to increase risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, even in young people who are not overweight.""

Wonder drug for Type-2 diabetics 
DIABETES will no longer be a death sentence for many sufferers with a drug commonly prescribed to lower sugar levels found to significantly reduce heart problems - the biggest killer of diabetics.
Australian doctors have now been given the green light to prescribe the drug Jardiance to Type-2 diabetics with cardiovascular issues with the change being hailed as a significant advance in the battle against the scourge of diabetes.
About 80 per cent of diabetics die from cardiovascular complications such as heart attack. Diabetes medications lower blood sugar, which can prevent complications like blindness and kidney damage, but do nothing for heart health. The Therapeutic Goods Association has now listed Jardiance for use to reduce cardiovascular deaths in diabetics - the first drug to ever offer that benefit.
Sydney cardiologist Professor Andrew Sindone hailed the drug as a ""big advance"" and said a third of his patients had diabetes. ""It's a big epidemic and this change will have a big impact on those people's health,"" he said.
The discovery was made while the drug was being safety tested with researchers finding it reduced the risk of a diabetic dying from cardiovascular disease by 38 per cent and reduced heart failure hospitalisation risk by 35 per cent.
Prof Sindone believed the drug would revolutionise management of diabetic patients.
He said those on the drug passed about 18 sugar cubes worth of glucose through their urine every day and dropped about 5kg in three months. After rigorous scrutiny of the study, which was published in 2015, Australian authorities have now approved the drug for use in cardiac health.

Kill accused's prison illness scare: friend
A MAN accused of murder became seriously ill after having a diabetic episode in the Tasmanian prison system, his former partner claims.
Kerry Alexander Bilston is awaiting trial for the shooting murder of his neighbour Peter Manshanden, 47, in Lottah, in the state's northeast, on October 15.
The 65-year-old, who has pleaded not guilty, is a diabetic and suffers anxiety, friend and former girlfriend Cally Gillies says.

Diabetes sufferers to get $54m for glucose monitor
Election 2016
The fingertips of young Noah Davies are a mess, thanks to routine pinpricks to check his blood glucose levels. But that's about to change, now that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has pledged $54 million funding for new technology that could end a ritual familiar to anyone with Type 1 diabetes.
The move has the backing of the Labor Party.
The constant glucose monitor is a device that monitors blood sugar and transmits the results to a smartphone or an insulin pump.
Noah's mother Megan, from Canberra, says her son was diagnosed with diabetes at 18 months and now wears an insulin pump. He's a candidate to receive one of the new devices. With the CGM monitor, they'll be able to check results on a phone.
""Instead of giving him a blood test, we'll be able to see if he is high or low and adjust accordingly,"" Ms Davies told reporters in Campbelltown, where Mr Turnbull was campaigning in the Liberal marginal seat of Macarthur.
The $54 million will subsidise the cost of devices for about 4000 young people aged up to 20.
It was an announcement that played into Mr Turnbull's innovation message to Australians and how using the latest technology can help children live normal lives. 'It's really life-changing,"" he said.

Friendly advice helps change diabetics ' lives
In the days when diabetes educator Eileen Collins ran marathons and didn't have children, she says she advised a 40-something woman with diabetes whose lifestyle was so maxed-out that wedging in time for regular exercise felt impossible.
When Collins tried to motivate her to make lifestyle changes, it backfired, but proved a valuable career experience, adds Collins.
""I remember saying to her, 'I get up really early in the morning and do the running before work.'
""I saw her eyes glaze over and I realised even then that I'd lost her; that that was just such a stupid thing to say. Whereas now I might say, 'Do you think there's any way you can fit some physical activity into your life?' And if they say no, I leave it there.""
Collins, Diabetes Victoria's education services team leader, says her role largely centres around ""informing, empowering, supporting and explaining"".
She sees clients to determine if other conditions are affecting their diabetes; educates them about medication, insulin, food and exercise, ensures they're having required screenings done and monitors their health and wellbeing.
She estimates she devotes half her time to supporting clients and the other half to team leadership.
""I like supporting the younger staff members and assisting them with their development,"" she says.
""We've got a great team and they've all got great skills, but some are less experienced, so I love it when they ask for my advice and support in their work.""
Collins, who works in a general practice one day a week, has a graduate diploma in health education, and nursing and midwifery experience. She joined Diabetes Victoria seven years ago and started her current role last year. Collins has 25 years' experience as a diabetes educator and says volunteering as a nurse educator in Western Samoa in the 1980s was valuable.
""Living and working in another culture gives you a perspective on your own culture and your own country,"" she says.
""Nowadays, when we're talking to people with diabetes we realise we have to be aware of things like health literacy and that was probably the first place I learned...
""We also saw a lot of people living with diabetes who didn't have the opportunities that a lot of people in Australia have with the care of their diabetes and it made me appreciate that.""
One of Collins' next goals is to contribute to developing more Diabetes Victoria educational resources for clients of diverse literacies. ""We're always learning,"" she says. ""I've been in diabetes education for 25 years and there have been so many changes.""

Cuts to cost diabetics 'hundreds of dollars'
Health funding - Extra pathology costs to be passed to patients
Diabetics could be out of pocket hundreds of dollars each year for their treatment if cuts to pathology go ahead, raising the risk of complications including kidney disease, doctors warn.
Health Minister Sussan Ley flagged plans to cut and limit bulk billing incentive payments for pathology and diagnostic imaging services last month, saving the government $650 million over four years.
Dr Nick Musgrave, president of Pathology Australia, said that without the payment, most pathology services would no longer be bulk-billed. Major pathology providers have already indicated they will pass losses from the cuts on to patients.
About 1.7 million Australians with diabetes, he said, could have to pay more than $400 upfront for a year of standard blood and urine tests to monitor their kidneys and risk of heart disease. Higher costs could deter some patients from doing the tests ""making management of their diabetes more difficult for their doctors, and will result in an increase in complications of diabetes including kidney disease and blindness,"" Dr Musgrave said.
This follows reports that the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia said pap smears could cost women at least $30 upfront if the cuts go ahead. Ms Ley's spokesman last week said that the government was not changing the Medicare rebate for pap smears but removing an ""inefficient payment"" to pathology firms. Patients would be ""rightly suspicious"" of providers claiming they will raise costs to make up losses, he said.
Dr Musgrave said that even with the rebate, patients with diabetes will still be left about $270 out of pocket a year, as the Medicare rebate for pathology services had been frozen for the past 20 years: ""It doesn't matter how the government would like to construct the funding of the tests, [the bulk-billing incentive is] part of the overall funding for them.""
Diabetes educator and nurse Cheryl Steele said that Type 2 diabetes patients over 50 years, including pensioners, were most likely to forgo pathology tests, risking kidney and cardiovascular diseases, because they often already pay for multiple medications.
""We have patients who will take medication for blood pressure this month and cholesterol next month because they can't afford it all,"" Ms Steele said.
Dr Musgrave said that higher pathology fees could also deter patients from getting tested for conditions that do not display obvious initial symptoms, including cervical, bowel and prostate cancers.
Health Minister Sussan Ley's spokesman said the Medicare rebate for pathology tests remained the same, and the tests were still covered by the Medicare Safety Net.

Explosion in diabetes care costs

The annual bill for health care related to the disease is already estimated at $2.85 billion, but that is expected to reach $5.86 billion - and $30 billion nationwide - by 2025.
""Any preventive measures now are a drop in the ocean compared to our costs once diagnosed,"" Diabetes Queensland CEO Michelle Trute said. ""For every stat there is a person behind it, and their families. The human cost of diabetes is inestimable.
""The health care cost for every person with type 1 diabetes is about $3468 per annum, which can rise to an average of $16,698 if there are complications.
""For type 2 diabetes, it's a cost of $4025 and $9645 with complications."" Ms Trute said while type 1 diabetes could not be cured or prevented, 60 per cent of type 2 diabetes cases could be delayed or prevented with an active lifestyle and healthy eating.
The number of Queenslanders with type 2 diabetes is now 195,000 - 10 times the figure 20 years ago.

Antibiotics linked to diabetes epidemic
Antibiotic use could increase the risk of developing diabetes, Danish research suggests.
A study of almost 1.5 million people in Denmark has found that those who used more antibiotics proved more likely to develop type 2 diabetes over the following decades.
Crunching data from three national health registries, the researchers analysed prior antibiotic use by more than 170,000 diagnosed diabetics and more than 1.3 million healthy ""controls"". They found the diabetics had used antibiotics 60 per cent more frequently, on average.
The report, published today in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, accords with the findings of a recent study of one million Britons.
It may help explain the 21st-century epidemic in diabetes, one of Australia's most pressing health challenges. About 1.7 million Australians are thought to have the condition, with 280 new diagnoses every day.
The vast majority, 85 per cent or more, contract type 2 diabetes, which is blamed on genetic predisposition, poor diet and lack of exercise. The new study points to another potential cause. ""We found people who have type 2 diabetes used significantly more antibiotics up to 15 years prior to diagnosis,"" said co-author Kristian Mikkelsen. Dr Mikkelsen said while it was impossible to infer ""causality"", the findings suggested that antibiotics could trigger the disease by shifting the balance of bacteria in the gut and favouring microbes that undermined the body's ability to metabolise sugar. But it was equally possible that the patients were more prone to infection over the years it took to develop fully blown diabetes, prompting them to take more antibiotics.

Gastric band surgery hope for diabetics 
Survey findings - Reduced health risks
Every time Brian Henry moves a 20-kilogram bag of firewood, the same thought crosses his mind. The chunks of redgum are a reminder of what he has lost.
And he couldn't be happier - or healthier.
After being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes in 2009, the 64-year-old grandfather slimmed down, dropping 20 kilograms in the 12 months following gastric band surgery.
Mr Henry can again fit into the pants he wore when he met his wife 20 years ago.
And he says he has a lot more energy - handy when you have eight grandchildren.
But the best thing of all is that his diabetes has gone into remission, meaning he can throw away his insulin, with which he had to inject himself daily.
""I found injecting myself very difficult,"" he said. ""I never got used to having to pierce my body with a sharp implement; it was a strange feeling.""
Mr Henry participated in a long-term Monash University study looking at whether moderately overweight people with type-2 diabetes would benefit from gastric band surgery.
Previous studies have looked at the benefits for obese people with a body mass index of 35 or above, but the five-year research by Monash's Centre for Obesity Research and Education looked at those with a BMI of between 25 and 30.
The findings, published in the journal Diabetes Care, suggest the current guidelines - which say surgery should be reserved for people with a BMI in excess of 35 - should be revised.
Led by endocrinologist John Wentworth and weight loss surgeon Paul O'Brien, the research showed gastric band surgery significantly reduced health risks for overweight people with type-2 diabetes.
Almost a quarter of participants who had surgery had their diabetes go into remission within five years.
In the control group of type-2 diabetes patients considered overweight, just 9 per cent had their diabetes go into remission.
Participants who had gastric band surgery reported an average weight loss of 12.2 per cent of body weight, compared with 1.8 per cent in the control group.
""Even if you are mildly overweight, substantial weight loss is going to deliver significant health benefits,"" Dr Wentworth said.
He said that while changes to diet and exercise should be the first port of call for those trying to lose weight, the benefits of surgery should not be overlooked.
""If someone wants to do it, this is pretty good evidence to suggest it is worthwhile,"" he said.
The average cost of the gastric band surgery and aftercare is $13,910, but those who no longer require diabetes medication would save an average of about $4260.
Conducted between 2009 and 2016, the research found some patients experienced adverse side effects. Three had transient difficulty with swallowing and two needed revision surgery. However, they were in the minority.
Dr Wentworth said that while it was a small study, involving 45 people at the five-year mark and 48 at the two-year mark, he expected the results would translate on a larger scale.
For Mr Henry, the experience has been a positive one. While he misses eating steak - ""I'm a chicken and fish person now"" - he knows it's a small price to pay.
""You do lose some things, but the gain is your health,"" he said.

Health wrap diabetes glucose monitor
Federal funding for a potentially lifesaving diabetes management device is crucial, according to the team behind the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre.
As part of its advocacy role, the centre wants to highlight the need for a government subsidy for the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.
By automatically measuring glucose levels 24 hours a day, it can help a type 1 diabetic better manage their condition by providing a constant record of glucose readings and track how food, exercise and other factors affect them.
It can also alert them when blood-sugar levels fall below a threshold, indicating they are experiencing a hypoglycaemic episode which, if left untreated, can lead to a diabetic coma.
Centre general manager Rebecca Johnson said use of a CGM system could provide huge relief to families.
""This can change a family's life,"" she said.
""People with young children with type 1 are constantly fatigued because they are up through the night testing their child and they never get a night off from it.""
She said parents could place the monitor next to their bed at night-time to check their child's levels without having to get up or wake their child to do a finger-prick test.
""It can also be set up to sound an alarm when blood glucose is dropping dangerously low,"" she said.
""This can happen in the middle of the night when a person with diabetes is asleep and unaware. This alarm system can wake them up and save their life.""
But Ms Johnson said the ""prohibitive"" cost of the sensors meant it hadn't been widely adopted.
The centre wanted to make it more affordable by campaigning to have the sensor added to the NDSS.
This National Diabetes Services Scheme is funded by the Federal Government and delivers diabetes-related products, such as needles, blood-glucose testing strips and insulin-pump-infusion sets, at subsidised prices.
A sensor, which is inserted under the skin, usually in the stomach, to check glucose levels in tissue fluid, can cost about $100 and must be replaced up to every seven days.
A small attached transmitter then sends this information to a wireless monitor or insulin pump.
""It can cost about $5000 to run it all year,"" Ms Johnson said.
""Not only does it have good outcomes for hypo preventions, it greatly improves quality of life - for the whole family.
It is for this reason that we are urging the Federal Government to subsidise the sensors to ensure more people can afford to use it.""
She said it was important for the type 1 community to be exposed to the continuous-glucose-monitoring system and understand its benefits.
They would then be the best advocates to push for government assistance.

WA women in diabetes study
Pregnant women in WA are being recruited into Australia's biggest study into the causes of type 1 diabetes.
Australian researchers have secured $8 million to study 1400 pregnant women and their babies to see how genetic and environmental factors influence the development of type 1 diabetes.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation announced the project yesterday. It will be funded by grants from the Helmsley Charitable Trust and the Federal Government-funded ARC Special Research Initiative.
The WA arm of the study will be done by the Telethon Kids Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital and the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research.
Known as the Environmental Determinants of Islet Autoimmunity Study, it is the only project of its kind in the southern hemisphere.
It will investigate pregnant women across Australia whose unborn or newborn baby has an immediate relative with type 1 diabetes.
This could be the mother, the baby's father or a sibling.
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that destroys the ability to produce insulin, and people with the condition face daily blood tests and insulin injections or pump infusions.
More than 120,000 Australians are affected.
Principal investigator Jenny Couper, from the University of Adelaide and the Women's and Children's Hospital, said the study would identify how environmental factors, together with a person's genes, affected their risk of getting type 1 diabetes.
""We believe children are exposed to the environmental triggers that lead to type 1 diabetes very early in life - perhaps even before they're born,"" Professor Couper said.
Professor Len Harrison from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne, said: ""This is the first study in the world to apply high-tech science from early pregnancy to understand how genes and environment interact to cause type 1 diabetes.""

Bright hope in battling diabetes 
Ginger has been cherished for both its culinary and medicinal properties for thousands of years.
It is widely recognised as an effective treatment for nausea related to both motion sickness and morning sickness during pregnancy.
But research published this year in the Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research has sparked interest for ginger as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.
The 12-week study looked at the effects of a daily two-gram dose of ginger powder on glucose metabolism. Participants were non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetics, and continued to take their regular medications during the trial.
Some 22 received the ginger treatment, while the other 19 were given lactose as a placebo.
Compared with those taking the placebo, those taking ginger powder had 12 per cent lower fasting blood glucose by the end of the trial. Their HbA1c readings (a three-month marker for blood sugar levels) also dropped by 10 per cent, as did several strong markers of heart disease.
For perspective, lowering HbA1c by just 1 per cent reduces heart attack risk by 14 per cent and risk of diabetes-related death by 21 per cent.
The results of this study are very impressive... some would even say too impressive.
There have been other animal and human studies in this area, which found more modest and somewhat mixed results. More research is certainly needed.
In any case, the link between ginger and glucose metabolism is an exciting new area of research. If your blood sugar levels remain high, it could be worth adding some ginger to your dinners or sipping on some ginger tea each morning.
There are many herbs and spices that contain medicinal properties, which science is now confirming. If you'd like to learn more, come see us at Darwin Dietitians. You can make an appointment at www.darwindietitians. com.au or call us on 08 8911 0622.

Taxpayers to pay diabetics' surgery costs
DIABETICS struggling with obesity could be encouraged to undergo lap-band surgery with taxpayers to pick up the tab.
New research, identified as being of ""great interest"" to Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley, points to cases where extreme weight loss through lap-band surgery appears to have cured type 2 diabetes.
It is estimated more than one million Australians, or 5 per cent of adults, have diabetes. Of those people, about 85 per cent have type 2.
The Federal Government is moving to overhaul how chronic diseases, which are a drain on the taxpayer, are treated and managed.
The findings from Newcastle University in the UK come as the Australian Health Department finalises its implementation of its national diabetes strategy.
A department spokeswoman yesterday told The Courier-Mail the implementation phase of the strategy ""would include consideration of lap banding for people with diabetes who would benefit"".
Ms Ley (pictured) said she was interested in the study.
""Obesity is a well-recognised driver in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, however, why this is the case and what actually triggers it are things we largely don't know,"" she said.
""Lap banding is one of a range of management therapies available for people with diabetes, so this latest research is of great interest."" Taxpayers help pay for lap-band surgery to treat patients with extreme obesity.
In the past financial year, federal taxpayers paid $21 million for 108,000 bariatric surgery services.
The Medicare Benefit Schedule lists several procedures for the surgical treatment of severe obesity, including lap-band surgery. The Newcastle University study said it had reversed the condition of 18 patients after lap-band surgery who lost a significant amount of weight. Scientists believe type 2 diabetes could be linked to fat in the pancreas.

Diabetes curse headed for 600 million adults
Pandemic follows global growth of Western lifestyle, says Guy Barnett
A DIABETES global pandemic is accelerating through the Developing World with four out of every five people diagnosed.
In Africa, diabetes has increased at alarming rates from 2.5 million in 2000 to 14.2 million in 2015 and 34 million estimated in 2040.
In the Middle East and North Africa region, diabetes has increased from 17 million in 2002, 35 million in 2015 and an estimated 72 million in 2040. India now has 52 million people with diabetes and China more than 100 million.
Western lifestyles have gone global with the ""oversize me"" mentality for eating and the high sugar, fat and salt diets, as well as sedentary living, non-active transport, and a world dominated by the internet, Google and mobile devices leading to problems.
We need to live more healthy lives. ""Energy in"" should balance ""energy out"", with a balanced, healthy diet with reduced sugar, salt and fat, and more physical activity.
The consequences are serious with five million deaths last year from diabetes around the world - more than double the deaths from HIV, tuberculosis and malaria combined. The bulk of these are in the Developing World.
Diabetes kills a person every six seconds, and someone loses a limb every 20 seconds because of diabetes.
The pandemic is getting worse, not better, with one new case every three seconds and nearly half of all adults with diabetes being undiagnosed. These people are certain to face serious health complications and/or an early death.
Type 2 diabetes used to be restricted to our older population, but it is now affecting more people middle-aged or younger still. The disease is not just causing a blowout in the health budget, but is consequently reducing productivity and negatively impacting on the economy.
Genetics is a key driver of the disease. Indigenous populations around the world are at much higher risk of diabetes with the Australian indigenous population between two times and six times more likely to have diabetes. Our Pacific island populations have among the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in the world.
Sadly, more than 40 countries do not even provide funding support for basic medicines such as insulin for people with diabetes, including type 1 diabetics who require insulin to survive. This is a tragedy, but thanks to the charity Life for a Child funds are raised and insulin is distributed to some in need. Others who cannot access insulin face certain death in a year or so.
The objective of the Parliamentary Diabetes Global Network is to provide support for people with diabetes, their families and those at risk around the globe.
We advocate for universal access to healthcare and basic medicine such as insulin for all people with diabetes.
Our network, through our Vancouver Proclamation, supports the World Health Assembly commitment to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025. It was encouraging to see the great progress Morocco is making and plans it has to address the diabetes epidemic in North Africa. It is encouraging that Australia has a national diabetes strategy.
Every country should treat diabetes as a priority to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of people with diabetes and to promote healthy lifestyles to prevent type 2 diabetes and the obesity epidemic.
In 2015, a whopping 415 million adults are living with diabetes and by 2035 this is estimated to increase to 600 million. In 2015, a further 316 million adults have impaired glucose tolerance or a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and by 2035 this is set to increase to 471 million.
Worryingly, nearly half the people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.
Four out of every five new cases of diabetes are from the Developing World. Guy Barnett is Liberal member for Lyons and president of the Parliamentarians for Diabetes Global Network. This is an edited extract of a speech he gave at a symposium on diabetes and nutrition in Morocco on May 13-14.

'Trick toxin' may aid diabetics 
A molecular ""trick"" evolved by one of the Great Barrier Reef's most potent killers could be harnessed to bring relief to diabetics.
An Australian-led study has determined how the geographer cone, the most dangerous of the beautiful but deadly cone shells that stalk the reef, brews up a ""cut-down"" version of insulin to immobilise its victims.
The finding, published in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, gives scientists a new lead in a decades-long quest for rapidly acting diabetes treatments. ""We can fiddle with human insulin to embed it (with) the same design principles,"" said senior author Mike Lawrence of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne. ""People have been trying to make this smaller version of insulin for a very long time, and haven't succeeded."" Last year, biologists from the University of Utah discovered a new form of insulin among the weapons the geographer cone uses to hunt fish in a toxin composed of shorter protein chains than any known insulin, enabling it to stun victims immediately. At least five of its other poisons are being analysed as potential painkillers that may prove 100 times as effective as morphine.

Diabetes sends cancer risks soaring
PEOPLE with diabetes have up to a 70 per cent increased risk of developing certain cancers, a new study has shown.
With more than 260 new cases of type one and two diabetes added to Australia's national diabetes registry every day, experts say the findings should mean cancer screening is part of standard diabetes treatment.
The study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, found both types of diabetes put people at ""excess risk of incidence and mortality"" overall, and for cancer.
Type two diabetes put people at greater risk of most cancers, but specifically increased the risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia by 60-70 per cent, gallbladder cancer by 50-58 per cent and kidney and bladder cancers by 20-70 per cent. Women with type one diabetes had an 80 per cent increased risk of brain cancer, and 50 per cent more for of endometrial cancer.

World-first attempt to prevent type 1 diabetes 
Health - Four-year-old pioneer
With cord blood in the bank, a little girl is dipping into her savings in an effort to stop the disease, writes Amy Corderoy.
Isla Robinson is a very special little girl. At four years old she might not be old enough to understand it, but on Wednesday she made scientific history.
Isla was the first person in the world to be injected with blood stored from her umbilical cord when she was born in an effort to prevent her developing type 1 diabetes.
Researchers hope the blood, rich in immune cells, will help reboot her immune system to prevent the condition, which occurs when the body attacks and kills its own insulin-producing cells.
Fairfax Media first reported in 2012 that the study, run through the Kids Research Institute at the Children's Hospital at Westmead, would in future be looking for people who banked their cord blood.
""It just seemed like a good insurance policy I suppose,"" Isla's mother, Rachel Weldon, said of her decision to bank her daughter's cord blood in 2011. ""Now being involved in this trial we just feel so grateful.""
Isla's family were chosen to be included because her half-brother has type 1 diabetes. She and her sister Ruby, 6, both had blood tests to look for antibodies in their blood that indicated the condition was developing.
Ruby was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes only days after her first blood test. Since then, Isla has had tests every six months and the medical team went ahead with the transfusion this week after she went from having only one to three of the four possible antibodies in her blood that put her at a very high risk of developing the condition.
""All the studies suggest she will actually develop it one day, so if we can stop that it would be fantastic,"" said study leader Maria Craig. ""I'm hoping we can completely switch off that autoimmune process and she will never get it.""
Another possibility is that the cord blood, and in particular the high amount of immune cells called T-cells it contains, will not prevent diabetes in the long-term, but will significantly delay the age at which Isla develops it.
""It could be many years while it dampens down her immune response,"" Professor Craig said. ""Even if it could delay it to adolescence, until she is older, that would be fantastic because that also buys us time for other therapies that are being developed.""
The blood had been collected from Isla's umbilical cord, and cryoprotective agents added so it could be stored in temperatures below minus 160 degrees.
On Wednesday, it was defrosted, washed and diluted and then slowly infused back into her body over a period of nearly half an hour.
Before the infusion, Isla was given a mild antihistamine to prevent allergic reaction, and antibiotics, as well as having a blood test.
It was the only part of the procedure that seemed to upset the brave four-year-old. Lucky, staff at Westmead were on hand with flower and Kung Fu Panda stickers to make it better.
Professor Craig said Isla was the first of 20 children who would receive the transfusion. At first only blood banked at Australia's largest private blood bank, Cell Care (sponsor of the study) was eligible, it will now be extended to other banks and to people in New Zealand and the US.
Critics of the expanding private cord blood-banking market have raised concerns that it will encourage parents to spend large amounts of money banking blood they will never use. But Professor Craig said the evidence of the value of T-cells in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and neurological disorders had only increased since the study was launched in 2012, with some providers offering discounts for clinical trials.
But Isla's sister Ruby, who has already developed type 1 diabetes, knows it won't be too bad if her little sister develops it as well - she says life with diabetes is just ""normal"".
In the meantime she has enjoyed the trip to Sydney from the family's home state of Western Australia, which has featured a visit to a pirate ship and a gift of new puzzles at the children's hospital.
""I'd stay here for a bit longer,"" she said.

Shares in the company, which only floated on the Australian Securities Exchange in April, soared 50.5c to 71c, recapitalising it at $35.9 million.
Founder, managing director and major shareholder Richard Lipscombe said the PromarkerD test measured biological signatures in the blood of diabetes sufferers to determine the likelihood of them contracting DKD.
He said the ability to predict the onset of the disease with a simple blood test and then provide preventative treatment could save health care systems globally ""billions of dollars"".
""We got into the diabetes area because of the size of the problem,"" Dr Lipscombe told WestBusiness. ""And technically and clinically this is extremely exciting.""
The test was developed after a five-year, WA-based $2 million clinical study of 576 patients with diabetes.
An estimated 382 million people suffer from diabetes worldwide, with the disease expected to affect 10 per cent of the population by 2035.
US data shows 35 per cent of diabetes sufferers have chronic kidney disease and 20 per cent develop kidney failure.
Dr Lipscombe, who was yesterday flying to brief investors and brokers on the east coast, said the next step was to push the test to commercialisation.
The process generally took 12 to 24 months, he said.

No pregnant pause for fitness
THE notion of eating for two during pregnancy should be scrapped and replaced with stronger guidelines recommending exercise and healthy eating for the best chance of cutting complications for mother and baby.
A landmark international study has found maintaining a healthy diet and continuing, or even starting exercise during pregnancy can reduce the risk of gestational diabetes by a quarter and the risk of caesarean section deliveries by 10 per cent. Other health benefits for both mother and child have also been found by maintaining a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy, regardless of a woman's age or whether she was obese or normal weight when becoming pregnant.
The study of more than 12,500 women from 16 countries - including thousands from Australia overseen by researchers from Melbourne's Monash University - has offered the strongest proof yet that moderate exercise should continue while pregnant.
Monash's Professor Helena Teede said there are clear benefits for constant moderate intensity activities such as aerobic classes, stationary cycling or resistance training for muscle groups in pregnancy.
""What was shown clearly in this evidence is that exercise is not detrimental in pregnancy,"" Prof Teede said.
""The evidence is that Australian women drop their physical activity dramatically during pregnancy, so many are already inactive before pregnancy, and in pregnancy we drop that down considerably.
""This study (shows) that physical activity has a very significant benefit in pregnancy and is not causing harm - so this is righting those myths."" The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found maintaining a healthy diet of restricted sugary drinks, low-fat dairy products and increased fruits and vegetables could cut dangerous complications.
With one in six Australian pregnancies impacted by gestational diabetes, Prof Teede said only a slight increase in food intake should occur - the equivalent of eating the same amount of food during the first trimester, an extra salad sandwich a day during the second trimester, and the equivalent of an extra chicken and salad sandwich a day in the third trimester - though no dieting.
""This is about women understanding what their healthy weight targets are and changing their lifestyle and increasing their activity so they reach those targets,"" she said.
She said there needed to be new guidelines for mums. ""This is yet another message for Australian policymakers. We have to help pregnant mums to make healthier choices, we have to make it easier for them to make lifestyle changes,"" she said.

Diabetes revolution
DIABETIC patients at seven Australian hospitals will get a ""game-changing artificial pancreas"" that automatically senses when they need insulin and pumps it into their body.
The Australian-first trial, run by the University of Melbourne and St Vincent's Hospital, aims to see if blood glucose levels can be stabilised, improving quality of life.
A proof-of-concept trial of an earlier version of the artificial pancreas proved successful for a short period in a small group of patients. This trial will test the device in 120 adults over six months.
Associate Professor David O'Neal, leading the study, said the artificial pancreas's capacity to automatically and precisely control glucose levels made it a game-changer.
""This trial is to show that it can be used in everyday care at home in patients with Type 1 diabetes, to not only improve their blood sugar control but translate into something meaningful in terms of sleep quality, psychological wellbeing and ability to function.
""It's not a cure for diabetes, but it lifts some of the burden on patients,"" Prof O'Neal said.
Type 1 diabetes, an auto-immune condition in which the body destroys insulin-producing cells, affects more than 120,000 Australians.
Leanne Foster, 47, who was diagnosed at age 11, is the first to be fitted with the device.
A small subcutaneous sensor detects blood glucose levels, which are wirelessly transmitted to an insulin pump containing a computer. ""It takes the information and adjusts insulin levels every five minutes,"" Prof O'Neal said.
Mrs Foster said that within days she felt as though ""the 'brain fog' from high or low sugars has lifted. This device could be life-changing."" She must still check glucose levels manually to calibrate the pump and program the device with details of her diet, but spends less time monitoring and thinking about diabetes.
Should the device prove effective, it is hoped there will be equitable access to it to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit.
The artificial pancreas trial, which will also involve 140 children in a Western Australia-led trial, is being funded by the Australian Research Council and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
The Victorian hospitals involved in the trial are St Vincent's, the Royal Melbourne, and The Alfred.

Tax on sugar gains traction
CALLS for a local sugar tax have been bolstered by a major Australian-led study showing for that sugary drinks, irrespective of obesity or weight gain, can cause type 2 diabetes.
An Australian National University-led study of 40,000 adults has shown the more sugary drinks consumed by an individual the higher diabetes risk, meaning skinny people are not immune.
Men and women react differently to sugar-filled drinks like soft drink, flavoured milk and sweetened juices, and women are far more likely to develop type 2 diabetes from regular consumption as opposed to men.
The study of 40,000 Thai adults from 2005 to 2013 has shown sugar-sweetened beverages are driving our diabetes epidemic. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes sugar. About 1.7 million Australians have diabetes, with 85-90 per cent Type 2 cases.
It is estimated 500,000 Australians have undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, the ANU study showed women had a much bigger risk of diabetes associated with sugar-sweetened drinks.
Women who consumed one or more sugary beverages a day had a 90 per cent higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes simply due to their liquid sugar consumption and irrespective of their body mass index. Those who had between one and six sugar-sweetened beverages a week were 50 per cent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes. Over the eight-year period only men who consumed one or more beverages a day saw a 30 per cent increase in risk.
Previously it has been assumed that obesity and sugar drinking go hand-in-hand. The latest study also showed over 4000 cases of Type 2 diabetes could be prevented annually in the Thai population if people avoided sugary drinks daily.
Lead author Keren Papier said that figure would easily translate to the Australian population.
In addition to a sugar tax, she also said warnings for women in particular to drink less of the beverages could be necessary.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has ruled out bringing in a sugar tax.

Sunlight stymies obesity, diabetes
Perth researchers have found that small doses of sunlight ward off obesity and diabetes and could help children stay slim.
The findings, part of an international trial using mice and published in the journal Diabetes, show regular exposure of the skin to moderate amounts of ultraviolet radiation - such as a few minutes in the summer midday sun - suppresses the development of obesity and the diabetes-linked metabolic syndrome.
Vitamin D, produced by the body in response to sunlight and often lauded for its health benefits, did not play a role.
The effects were linked to the compound nitric oxide, which is released by the skin after exposure to sunlight.
The study was carried out by the Telethon Kids Institute, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research and the universities of Edinburgh and Southampton. Researchers showed that shining UV light on overfed mice slowed weight gain and reduced signs of diabetes such as abnormal glucose levels and insulin resistance.
Telethon Kids researcher Shelley Gorman said exposing mice on a high-fat diet to a high dose of UV radiation of about 10 minutes in midday summer sun, or a low dose of two to three minutes, warded off the development of obesity and diabetes symptoms.
""We didn't observe the same effect in mice fed a diet that included vitamin D supplements, so the mechanism seems to be due to other factors induced by sunlight,"" Dr Gorman said. ""The findings are important as they suggest that casual exposure of the skin to sunlight, together with plenty of exercise and a healthy diet, may help prevent the development of obesity in children.""
More research was needed to better understand the effect and people concerned about the benefits of exposure to UV radiation from sunlight were advised to check guidelines on safe levels of exposure. Studies also needed to confirm whether UV radiation had the same effect on people as on mice.
Perth co-author Prue Hart said that while the research had significance around the world, it was particularly important in Australia.
""Given our climate and our lifestyle, our research is very relevant to the future health and wellbeing of our kids and we look forward to expanding on it,"" she said.

Apple 's sweet on fighting diabetes 
AN Apple a day may soon keep the doctor away for Australia's 1.75 million diabetics.
In a move welcomed by experts, the notoriously secretive tech giant's next big thing is rumoured to be a device that can measure blood sugar levels without the need for a painful finger prick.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook set tongues wagging when he announced he was wearing a prototype device and the company has hired a bunch of bio-engineers with expertise in the area. Little else is known about the device but it is likely to use optical sensors to shine a light through the skin to measure glucose.
Apple is not the only player in this field. Three years ago Google unveiled a prototype contact lens that could test for sugar levels, though it has not yet brought it to market.
And closer to home, Brisbane-based medical firm Glucotek Inc recently lodged a patent for smart earrings that work as non-invasive blood glucose monitors. The company is currently finalising a prototype and last month was named the winner of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology entrepreneurial boot camp involving 6000 applicants from 30 countries.
Dr Sof Andrikopoulos, head of the Metabolism Research Group at the University of Melbourne and the president of Australian Diabetes Society, called the need for the frequent finger pricks one of the ""biggest psychologically painful things"" for people managing diabetes.
""Having any way of measure blood glucose or blood sugar without needing to prick your finger to get that little bit of blood is a huge leap advantage progress in management of diabetes,"" Dr Andrikopoulos said.
""The next step is to get to the point where you can do it non-invasively - that you could measure it without needing to insert something into your skin. Once we get to that point it is going to be absolutely huge. It's going to revolutionise the way we understand diabetes. It's going to revolutionise the way that we treat it."" But Diabetes Australia consumer manager Renza Scibilia, who also has type 1 diabetes, warned that while any technological advancement was welcomed, there were reasons to be cautious. She said unless any device could be proven to have an accuracy level suitable for a medical device, it would only be considered an activity tracker that provided health trend data rather than absolutely accurate readings.

Diabetes' hidden truth revealed Riley's battle puts focus on ignorance
WHEN little Riley Poprawski suddenly got sick and lost about a quarter of her body weight pretty significant when you only weigh 20kg her parents Ben and Sam were naturally worried.
At first, doctors told them it was a virus, and it would ""work itself out"". But when she didn't get better, the Poprawskis knew deep down something more severe was going on.
""We had thought that maybe she was diabetic, but I was in denial and hadn't accepted it,"" Mr Poprawski told the Mercury.
""Even when we were at the hospital having tests, I was still hopeful that it wasn't. I was pretty stressed about it, because we didn't know what it meant and what was going to happen.
""Sam felt guilty, because she only knew diabetes as an overweight person's disease caused by eating the wrong foods and not getting enough exercise.
""So she immediately thought it was something she'd done wrong as a mother. For a mother, there's a lot of emotion involved. You could tell Sam it wasn't her fault, but she still felt that way for quite a while.""
Riley's condition isn't Sam's or anyone else's fault.
Riley is one of the about 10 per cent of diabetics with Type 1 diabetes, caused by the immune system mistakenly turning on itself and stopping the body from producing insulin, which is used to process sugar to create energy.
It is not known what triggers Type 1, and there is currently no cure.
But Type 1 is, unfortunately, often lumped in with the far more common Type 2, which is caused by eating poorly and failing to exercise and can often be managed by lifestyle and diet changes.
As a result, many people remain oblivious to the important differences between Types 1 and 2 something Mr Poprawski is determined to change.
""In the media there's not a lot of differentiation between the two types,"" he said.
""Whenever there's an article about obesity or schoolkids getting fat, they always say 'it puts them at risk of heart disease and diabetes', not Type 2 diabetes.
""People say 'Riley's too young to have diabetes', which of course isn't true. Sam has heard 'that's why I don't feed my child sugar'. We actually had a teacher say 'I've got diabetes too, if you eat well and look after yourself you'll get better', but that's just not the case.
That extra pressure on Riley, who was diagnosed at age five and will soon turn eight, includes being attached to an insulin pump 24 hours a day, testing her blood up to 12 times a day, and being extremely careful about what she eats and drinks.
Her diagnosis also had a massive impact on her parents and siblings.
""It has changed our lives completely,"" Mr Poprawski said.
""It's on your mind 100 per cent of the time, including through the night.
""We've found her crying in her room, not wanting to go to bed because she's worried about having a hypo in her sleep.
""When she was sick [recently] she was off school for a whole week because we couldn't get her blood sugar levels under control. We had to take her to hospital because she was vomiting due to the toxins in her blood.
""It weighs on our minds so much because it's not something you can just let go for an hour it can be fatal if you don't look after it. And there's a very good chance that at least one of her siblings is going to end up with it too, because they have a genetic predisposition to it.""
As the chief executive of support and advocacy organisation Diabetes Tasmania, Caroline Wells deals with plenty of parents feeling the strain of having a child with Type 1.
She is also keen to help clear up confusion surrounding the different types of diabetes.
""You hear from parents that people have said to them 'you must have fed your child the wrong thing', when nothing could be further from the truth,"" she said.
""Type 1 is not at all related to diet or lifestyle it's an auto-immune disease that happens, and we want to find out why so we can seek a cure.
""I think it's incredibly important to raise community awareness about the types of diabetes and explain the differences to people, so they can actually understand the impact of Type 1 diabetes.""
Residents can help fight Type 1 diabetes by taking part in the annual JDRF Walk to Cure Diabetes, which has raised more than $28 million for research over the past 20 years.
The walk was held in Hobart for the first time last year and 150 people helped raise more than $20,000.
This year's event will be held on Sunday, November 3, starting from the Montagu Bay Reserve at 11am.
Participants can walk across the Tasman Bridge and back (4km) or around the foreshore (2km). Entry is free.

LIVING WITH DIABETES
More than 25,400 Tasmanians have been diagnosed with diabetes - a figure that is rising by about 170 a month.
An estimated 8000-10,000 Tasmanians have Type 2 diabetes but are unaware of it. Another 45,000 are at high risk of developing the disease.
Type 2 is by far the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 90-95 per cent of all diabetes cases.
Family history, age, excess weight, lack of exercise and bad dietary habits all contribute to the onset of Type 2 diabetes.
80 per cent of people with Type 2 diabetes are either overweight or obese.
An autoimmune condition, Type 1 occurs when the pancreas does not produce insulin because the cells which make insulin have been destroyed by the immune system.
Type 1 accounts for just 5-10 per cent of all diabetes. About 3000 Tasmanians have Type 1. It mostly affects children and adolescents, but can occur at any age.
Warning signs for Type 1 may include thirst; frequent urination; lethargy; blurred vision; sudden weight loss; infections or wounds that don't heal; constant hunger; and mood swings.

Gift of new life
PARENTS will no longer have to worry about their diabetic kids dying through the night with the government today announcing free continuous glucose monitoring kits for children under 21.
The $54 million dollar announcement will see a sticker placed on the skin of a child or young person with diabetes to estimate blood glucose levels.
Alerts will be sent to parents' smartphones when their child's glucose levels become concerning and they can administer insulin immediately.
Currently continuous glucose monitoring kits cost up to $4000 a year, but from tomorrow they will be available to eligible families for free.
There are 15,000 child and teen type 1 diabetics sufferers in Australia, however it is estimated around 4000 will access the new program.
Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease that attacks a person's ability to produce insulin. Sufferers have to monitor their glucose levels around the clock.
It's estimated around 10 Australians with type 1 diabetes die each year overnight.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said continuous glucose monitoring would save lives and the hassle of the daily finger-prick for diabetics.
Diabetes Australia CEO Greg Johnson said today's announcement would massively ease the burden for families with children suffering from type 1 diabetes.
""It is hard to overstate the significance of this,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It will literally change lives and save lives in thousands of Australian families where children and young people have type 1 diabetes."" Mt Eliza twins Ayden and Connor Macpherson, 13, and their sister Bella, 10, all have type 1 diabetes. Parents, Brett and Shannon, check the glucose levels of all three at midnight and 3.30am.
""Our kids are pretty active with sport and can have delayed hypos so we have to do checks throughout the night,"" Ms Macpherson said. ""It's difficult and constant."" Eligibility assessment forms will be available at www.ndss.com.au.

Perth toddler first person to get artificial pancreas
A West Australian toddler has become the first person to be fitted with a device that acts as an artificial pancreas.
Four-year-old Xavier Hames, who has type-1 diabetes, will no longer require four daily injections after tubes were inserted under his skin, connecting to a small black box that acts as an insulin pump.
Xavier wears the device in a small pouch at his waist after it was fitted at Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for Children on Wednesday morning.
Professor Tim Jones, from PMH, said the contraption, developed as a result of clinical trials across Australia, would help families sleep better at night.
It is able to sense glucose levels, predicts when they will drop and stops insulin being delivered unless it is needed. This helps prevent hypoglycaemic attacks, particularly at night, which can cause seizures, induce comas and can sometimes be fatal.
""If it's able to stop hypoglycaemia and give people confidence that hypoglycaemia is not going to occur, it'll make a huge difference to lives,"" Professor Jones said.
While insulin pumps have existed for some time, he said ""the difference with this pump is that it's got a hypoglycaemia predictive algorithm within it, a small computer inside of it, that will give people a lot more confidence"".
Professor Jones said the pump delivers insulin through a plastic tube that is pushed under the skin, along with a sensor, also placed under the skin. ""That's done every three days. It's a simple procedure.""
Xavier's family have been taught how to insert the device, which is now commercially available, costs about $10,000 and can be used for adults and children.
Xavier's mother, Naomi Hames, said the device gave her peace of mind because up until now she was only confident of his well-being if she was up every hour during the night to monitor her son.
She said she was now looking forward to not having to give her son daily injections and said he would have much more freedom in terms of what he could eat. Previously, every bit of food needed to be considered in terms of his current glucose levels.

Vegetarian diet the most effective for weight loss, says study
Switching to a vegetarian diet can be twice as effective for weight loss as counting calories, according to new research.
For the study, published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, researchers from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine followed 74 participants with type 2 diabetes for six months.
Half the group was assigned a vegetarian diet (60 per cent of energy from carbohydrates, 15 per cent protein and 25 per cent fat) consisting of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with one portion of low-fat yoghurt a day.
The other half was assigned a conventional low-calorie, anti-diabetes diet comprising 50 per cent of energy from carbohydrates, 20 per cent protein and less than 30 per cent fat.
After six months, the vegetarian group had lost an average of 6.2 kilograms compared with 3.2 kilograms in the conventional group.
The researchers also used magnetic resonance imaging to analyse the effect of the two diets on adipose fat in participants' thighs.
While both diets reduced subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin), only the vegetarian diet caused reductions in subfascial fat (on the surface of muscles) and saw a greater reduction in intramuscular fat (fat inside the muscles).
Excess sub-fascial and intramuscular fat is associated with insulin resistance and lowered glucose metabolism.
""Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss,"" said lead author Dr Hana Kahleova.
""However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism.
""This finding is important for people who are trying to lose weight, including those suffering from metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes. But it is also relevant to anyone who takes their weight management seriously and wants to stay lean and healthy.""
Dr Joanna McMillan believes the vegetarian diet was more effective because it tends to include more fibre from plant foods. ""This helps to fill you up but also means the gut bugs have to help with nutrient retrieval. Potentially our gut bugs help us to stay lean or get fat depending on our individual microbiomes and usual diet.""
Our genes may come into play as well, as another new study, published in the journal Nature: Ecology and Evolution, found that the introduction of farming 10,000 years ago led to an increase in plant-based diets. This dietary shift from the animal-based diet of hunter-gatherers resulted in genetic adaptations that helped vegetarians and their offspring to better metabolise plant foods.

Diabetes link to fasting
EATING smaller meals is a way to lose weight, but skipping meals altogether has been linked to increased abdominal fat because of the way it confuses the body's metabolic systems and can increase the risk of diabetes.
Mice put on a restricted diet consumed all their food at once and then effectively fasted all day. These mice had extra fat around the middle of their bodies - similar to human belly fat.
The extra belly fat was due to a confused metabolic process in the mice's bodies.
After eating, the pancreas produces insulin to help process glucose from food. At times when there is too much insulin in the blood, the liver produces glucose to balance the system.
Because the mice were gorging themselves on food, their pancreases did not produce enough insulin to process glucose from their food. The result was extra glucose in the system that was eventually stored as fat.
""Under conditions when the liver is not stimulated by insulin, increased glucose output from the liver means the liver isn't responding to signals telling it to shut down glucose production,"" said Martha Belury, professor of human nutrition at Ohio State University. ""These mice don't have type 2 diabetes yet, but they're not responding to insulin any more... ""The study is published in The Journal of Nutritional Biology.

Low GI can cut bub's risk of obesity
EXPECTING mums who consume a low GI diet of wholegrains, leafy greens and yoghurt could help reduce their child's risk of developing obesity and diabetes in later life, an Adelaide study reveals.
The research shows female offspring born to mothers who ate a low GI diet - which includes a range of high fibre foods - had better glucose tolerance and lower abdominal fat mass compared with those who ate a higher GI diet.
The study, conducted at Adelaide University's FOODplus Research Centre, used pregnant rats who were fed special low GI ""pellets"" while others were given food that was much higher in GI.
They found the female offspring of the low GI diet mums were less likely to be obese and had a better glucose tolerance.
Researchers now plan to test whether consuming a low GI diet during pregnancy can reduce the impact of maternal obesity and diabetes on body fat mass and glucose tolerance in their offspring.
Lead researcher Dr Beverly Muhlhausler said a low GI diet was safe for pregnant women.
Foods that are low GI take longer to digest and therefore the nutrients of the foods are released into the blood more slowly and steadily. ""You stay fuller for longer... and that's beneficial for weight loss and weight maintenance,"" Dr Muhlhausler said.

Hope on diabetes lingers
A HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED trial of a daily insulin pill found it did not prevent or delay type 1 diabetes in high-risk people.
But researchers are still hopeful, turning their efforts to investigating if the dosage and timing needs to be tweaked or another therapy added.
Type 1 diabetes, an auto-immune condition which is not linked to lifestyle and can't be cured or prevented, destroys cells in the pancreas, which produces insulin. In the trial, people who had a relative with the disease and who tested positive for diabetes-related antibodies were given either an insulin tablet or a placebo.
Results published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed oral insulin did not significantly reduce the risk of diabetes in the 389 participants.
Royal Melbourne Hospital endocrinologist Associate Professor John Wentworth, who led the Australian and New Zealand arm of the 10-year trial, said it was disappointing the outcomes hadn't met expectations, but was buoyed by positive findings in a smaller group of people in the trial with more advanced disease.
""In those 54 people, there was an 18-month delay in their diagnosis of type 1 diabetes compared with the placebo group,"" Prof Wentworth said.
""It suggests quite strongly that in this small group of people who are well and truly on their way to type 1 diabetes, there was an exciting effect."" Findings of another trial testing different doses of oral insulin are expected next year.

'Diabesity' new Australian killer
The horror heart attack days of the 1960s have returned, with a report warning that Australians are headed for a renewed epidemic of heart disease fuelled by obesity and diabetes.
A combination of the two conditions, dubbed diabesity, had caused a resurgence of heart disease, Australia's number one killer, the Baker IDI report said.
It said the condition had wiped out many of the gains made to overcome spiralling rates of heart attacks and stroke in the past 50 years.
After decades of improvements, the number of heart disease deaths had flattened in the past five years and now appeared to be reversing, with a rise in fatalities this year for the first time in a decade.
With cardiovascular disease affecting more than 3.7 million Australians and accounting for 45,000 deaths a year, Baker IDI director Tom Marwick warned that cardiovascular complacency was a killer.
""The obesity epidemic is going to turn into more diabetes, and that is already happening,"" he said.
""The most common serious consequence of diabetes is cardiovascular conditions, heart attacks, strokes and kidney disease.
""Back in the 1950-60s the frequency of type 2 diabetes was much less, and people had coronary disease from their smoking and stuff like that. That problem is less than what it was but unfortunately the diabetes problem is more, and in addition to heart attacks and stroke, it is going to drive a bunch of other things, too.""
In the past 50 years life expectancy for Australians has risen by a decade.
That has been attributed to fewer deaths from heart attacks, stroke and blood vessel diseases.

SA just snack away from being fattest
SOUTH Australia is close to edging out Queensland to become the fattest Australian state.
The mounting overweight and obesity problem has also contributed to the state's position as the jurisdiction with the second-highest rate of type 2 diabetes in the country, behind the Northern Territory.
Despite growing public awareness about the national obesity epidemic, a report released today by the COAG Reform Council shows Australians have continued to put on weight in the past five years.
Reform Council chairman John Brumby warned the growing obesity rates would lead to more heart attacks, strokes and diabetes-linked blindness.
More than 27 per cent of Australians were overweight or obese in 2011-12. ""We have the rare distinction of being among the worst in the world,"" Mr Brumby said.
Failing to deal with obesity levels would increase pressure on the health system and on the economy.
""It's going to put more cost on the health system, on the hospital system, on families, on workplaces and on taxpayers, so it needs to be addressed,"" Mr Brumby said.
The report showed 29.2 per cent of adult South Australian residents were overweight or obese, compared to 30 per cent of Queenslanders.
Nationally, 4.3 per cent of adults had been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, with 7.4 per cent of Northern Territory residents suffering the disease.
In South Australia, 5.4 per cent of adults had type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is strongly linked to lifestyle, including being overweight.
Low-income earners are more likely than other Australians to be overweight. Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler said more needed to be done to help people manage weight problems and associated chronic illnesses.
But Professor Owler said the proposed $7 Medicare co-payment would discourage people from seeking GP help.
""If we're already seeing an impact among those who are disadvantaged, that's only going to be compounded by the introduction of a GP, pathology and diagnostic imaging co-payment,"" he said.
The COAG Reform Council report showed cost already deterred some Australians from seeking medical help. The report was one of the final pieces of work by the COAG Reform Council before its abolition this year. Mr Brumby said a body like the reform council was needed to independently assess if states met performance targets.

ARE YOU ON THE ROAD TO DIABETES?
Diabetes is the fastest-growing chronic health problem plaguing Aussies, yet many of us wouldn't know how to spot if we were at risk of the deadly disease, discovers Rosie King
One Australian is diagnosed with diabetes every five minutes. Of those, 85-95 per cent will be diagnosed with type 2, a condition that's both deadly and preventable.
Sof Andrikopoulos, CEO of the Australian Diabetes Society, describes type 1 and type 2 diabetes as diseases of the pancreas, in which the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin to regulate the glucose levels in our blood.
""With type 1, the immune system actually kills the cells that produce insulin so there's a complete deficiency. With type 2, the insulin-producing cells don't work efficiently so there's a relative deficiency.""
Type 2 used to typically affect men and women who were over 55. That's all changed now, Andrikopoulos says: ""When I started in diabetes research 25 years ago, you had to be over 55 to get type 2 but now we're seeing it in young adults, adolescents and even in children under 10. It all comes down to our lifestyle - the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are obese.""
To stop type 2 diabetes taking hold, be aware of signs that might indicate a fast-track to diagnosis. Left undiagnosed and untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to illness, amputation, even death.
SIGNS YOU'RE AT RISK If any of these ring true, now's the time to act. Talk to your GP or health care professional
EXPANDING WAISTLINE ""Waist circumference is strongly linked with diabetes risk,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If you're a man and your waistline is 102cm or above or you're a woman with a waist circumference of 88cm or higher, that's a very telling sign you could be heading down the path towards diabetes.
""Measuring your waist is easy, too. Just grab a measuring tape and wrap it around your belly. If it measures more than it should, it's a good idea to see someone about managing your weight, because as well as diabetes, you could be at risk of developing heart disease.""
BAD DIET ""A poor diet will accelerate your progression to type 2 diabetes but little tweaks can go a long way,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""Cutting down the number of sugary drinks you have or how many sugars you put in your coffee every day can mean a big reduction in your discretionary kilojoule intake. Over six months, the benefits of that are huge.""
It's a case of minimising the amount of treat foods you have now, so that you don't have to give them up forever.
""Once you've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, diet is critical to managing it properly,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""That means saying goodbye to all excessive kilojoules - the burgers, the pizza, the soft drinks. It all has to go.""
It's not just about avoiding certain foods, it's also a matter of eating enough fruit, veg, nuts, wholegrains and fish, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE ""Just as exercise improves insulin resistance, a lack of activity makes it harder for those insulin-producing cells to do their job, which accelerates the development of diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""You don't have to run a marathon or lift 100kg at the gym every day but you do need to move regularly. Walking for 30 minutes every day is a cheap and easy way to give your body what it needs and minimise the risk.""
FAMILY HISTORY ""If one of your parents has type 2 diabetes, your likelihood of developing it rises by 30 per cent,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If both parents have type 2 diabetes, that number jumps to 70 per cent. We can't control our genes or our parents but we can control other risk factors.
""If you have a family history of diabetes, be vigilant about being active, ensure your weight is in a healthy range, don't smoke and don't drink excessively. That's my advice to anyone, regardless of their history.""
SIGNS YOU'RE IN TROUBLE These symptoms of type 2 diabetes require immediate attention
FREQUENT TOILET VISITS ""Going to the toilet more than twice a night is a reasonably good indicator of type 2 diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""Once your glucose levels reach a certain concentration in your blood, your kidneys start excreting the glucose in your urine so you'll need to go more often.""
EXCESSIVE THIRST ""If you're going to the toilet a lot, you're losing a significant amount of water in your urine, which leads to excessive thirst,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""But that doesn't have to be the case.
Too much glucose in the blood can also flick the thirst switch in the brain so you'll continuously feel as though you need to be glugging down glasses of water.""
SENSITIVE SKIN ""When glucose levels are too high, our infection-fighting white blood cells don't work properly so skin irritations can be slow to heal,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""You might notice a rash that's hard to get rid of or a wound that takes an unusually long time to heal.
This shows your immune system is weak, which could mean your diabetes risk is elevated.""
BLURRED VISION AND NUMBNESS ""I'd expect you to have every other symptom as well because if it's come to the stage of blurred vision and numb fingertips, you have out-of-control diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""Put the newspaper down and get to your doctor quick-smart.""
WHAT ABOUT FATIGUE?
""Fatigue is a big but difficult one,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""With diabetes, your cells aren't working effectively or efficiently to secrete enough insulin, which can wreak havoc on your immune system and energy levels. It can be difficult to know what's causing a person's fatigue because it's a symptom of so many medical conditions - and our busy lives - but it's something to be mindful of if you're concerned about diabetes.""

Cheers to safe festive drinking
THE festive season is fast approaching, and for many people this means more socialising with family and friends.
Having diabetes doesn't mean that you can't have a drink or two, and in fact the alcohol recommendations for people with diabetes are the same as the general population. The National Health and Medical Research Council recommends no more than two standard drinks a day, with some alcohol-free days each week. However, some people may be advised to limit their intake further than these general recommendations, so it's important to discuss drinking with your diabetes health care team.
For people managing their diabetes with insulin or the glucose-lowering medication sulfonylurea, drinking alcohol increases the risk of hypoglycaemia (a drop in blood glucose level less than 4mmol/L), so it's recommended alcohol be consumed with a meal or snacks containing carbohydrate - such as bread, pasta, rice, potato, crackers or dried fruit.
Also, monitor blood glucose levels during and after drinking, especially before going to bed and overnight (if concerned) to avoid alcohol-related low blood glucose levels.
Although it is best to limit regular soft drink mixers, pre-mixed alcoholic beverages and sweet liqueurs, if there are no carbohydrate foods available, use a regular soft drink or fruit juice when mixing drinks to help avoid hypoglycaemia.
An Australian standard drink contains 10g of alcohol and includes 285ml regular beer, 425ml low-alcohol beer (less than 3 per cent alcohol), 100ml wine, 60ml fortified wine and 30ml spirits. It's easy to overestimate a standard drink, so it is important to be familiar with the size of a standard drink for each type of alcohol.
Measure out a standard drink to become familiar with what it looks like, and be aware that most wine glasses, when full, can hold two or more standard drinks. Remember, too, alcohol is high in energy (kilojoules or calories), therefore drinking large amounts regularly can lead to weight gain.

Focus on repelling a tsunami
AUSTRALIAN DIABETES COUNCIL - 75 YEARS
The University of Sydney is taking a holistic approach to diabetes research as experts warn that Australia is facing a diabetes ""tsunami"".
Each year, about 100,000 people develop diabetes, making it Australia's fastest-growing chronic disease. There is no cure.
""In the past, diabetes studies have been focused in a pure stream of medical research but we now know that the disease cannot be solved by medical intervention alone,"" says Nicola Stokes, chief executive of the Australian Diabetes Council.
The council has donated $5 million to fund a new chair of diabetes at Sydney University's Charles Perkins Centre - a $385-million facility for research into the three related conditions of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
""The work at the [centre] represents a new way of thinking about the management of diabetes and its complications,"" Stokes says. ""It's not only a health issue, it's transport, urban planning, access to services from when you're very young, teaching about food in schools, being able to exercise and run around, all the way through to managing the disease and avoiding serious complications, which can include blindness, amputations, heart disease, kidney failure and stroke.""
She says food is crucial in preventing type-2 diabetes. ""We need to go right back to the basics of how food is grown, where it comes from, and what actually happens in the processing and treatment of food before it reaches our plate, and then what it does in our bodies.
""Governments need to address... why healthy fruit and vegetables are so much more expensive than unhealthy foods, and why there's some sort of fast-food option on every corner.
""Diabetes is the fastest-growing chronic disease in Australia, with 290 people being diagnosed every day. It's moving at a great rate and we're facing an epidemic - a tsunami. Without terrifying everybody, we need people to be really mindful of the disease and its complications, otherwise they will just ignore it.
""People need to understand the difference between type-1 - an auto-immune disease affecting about 15 per cent of diabetes patients - and the more common type-2 - a degenerative disease that's been linked to the environment in which you live and the nutritional choices you make.""
The candidate for the chair of diabetes will be announced shortly to coincide with the Australian Diabetes Council's 75th birthday.

A roller-coaster ride of emotions can rule life in type 1 diabetes
""But you're not fat?"" It may come across as rude and tactless, but this is something I hear repeatedly when someone finds out I'm living with type 1 diabetes.
No, I'm not overweight. I didn't eat too much sugar and I didn't spend my childhood in front of a television. I always ate vegetables, was active in sport and exercise daily.
There was nothing I could have done to prevent my pancreas from failing to produce insulin. I couldn't stop my body forcing me to depend on four injections a day to control my blood-glucose levels, and avoid accumulating dangerous chemical substances in my blood that could kill me.
The thing about type 1 diabetes is it's neither preventable nor curable, and unlike type 2, it cannot be managed with a healthy lifestyle.
It's a daily routine, a lifelong journey and the loss of spontaneity only those who live with it would understand.
A small finger prick was all it took for the doctor to confirm a future filled with doctors' appointments, routines, jelly beans and insulin.
Today, 120,000 Australians live with type 1 diabetes. It affects 10-15 per cent of the 1.1 million individuals living with diabetes in Australia, and each year in Australia, approximately 20 children per 100,000 aged under 15 develop the condition.
Imagine every different emotion controlling how your body is going to react in different ways each day and you'll begin to understand what it's like to live with.
Sleep, stress, other medications, sickness and hormones can all contribute to the rise and fall of blood-sugar levels.
Type 1 diabetes can onset at any age, but is most commonly developed in childhood and teenage years and is often referred to as juvenile diabetes.
It is not known why it occurs. It is thought some people have a genetic predisposition and a trigger, such as a virus, causes the immune system to destroy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.
Management includes lifelong insulin injections multiple times a day, blood-glucose monitoring, healthy eating and physical activity.
Diagnosis in childhood and adolescence can have a negative impact on mental and social health, particularly in teenagers.
Teenagers are going through personal growth and development that includes peer pressure, body image issues, discrimination, exercise, parties and alcohol.
The week of my diagnosis, at age 19, I was walking like a zombie. It still hadn't sunk in that I was in hospital when I should've been sitting my first-year university exams.
I recall walking through the city with my mother and father, sitting down for a coffee and looking around wondering whether the tall man in a business suit walking by was also impacted by this invisible condition, or the little girl in the flowery hat holding her grandmother's hand.
Diabetes is manageable, and doesn't stop people living an active, full life. Of 546 people who completed a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation survey named ""Type 1 Diabetes in the Media"", 93.6 per cent felt the media did not correctly distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and 83.9 per cent said websites of diabetes charities are the most trusted source of reliable information.
News media still confuse the two diseases.
By now, I am oblivious to the stares when I pull out my diabetes kit in public spaces such as the supermarket.
I'm used to the comments, ""Are you sure you should eat that?"" or ""Can you do that?"", and, though I know people are concerned, the lack of public education is astonishing.
Type 1 diabetics can eat what we want to eat, we can still do anything and live a normal life to a degree, we just have to be smarter about it.

HEALTHY MENU'S A BABY BOON
DIET can remove one of the most common and dangerous risks to gestational diabetes sufferers: big babies.
Sufferers are up to 50 per cent more likely to give birth to a large baby, which increases the risk of injury to mother and child during labour, makes caesarean deliveries more likely, and raises the risk that the babies will need special care.
Now, thanks to findings by the Royal Women's Hospital, published today in the Journal of Pregnancy, pregnancies of women with gestational diabetes who are able to meet blood sugar targets through dietary changes will no longer be classed as high-risk.
Lead researcher Dr Fatima Vally said the hope was that they would need fewer scans and specialist appointments in the final trimester, and would not need to have labour induced.
The researchers looked retrospectively at 202 women who controlled their gestational diabetes via their diet. A comparison by age and BMI with pregnant women without diabetes found their babies were, surprisingly, slightly smaller than average.
Marlouka Von Eisenhart-Rothe, due next week with her first child, has been able to remove herself from the high-risk group through diet changes following her diagnosis. ""It wasn't a big diet change, just a bit of trial and error. I had to stop drinking juice and have no honey in my tea, and make sure I spread all my food over the day,"" Ms Von Eisenhart-Rothe explained.

Gene find could reverse obesity
AUSTRALIAN scientists have unlocked the secrets of the fat gene and are a step closer to treatments that could reverse obesity and eventually prevent Type 2 diabetes.
Breakthrough research by scientists at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute has revealed that the MNK gene is involved in weight gain and the discovery could be used to fight obesity worldwide.
Head researcher Professor Chris Proud, the leader of SAHMRI's Nutrition and Metabolism team, said the gene was present in everyone but its role in obesity and the development of Type 2 diabetes was only triggered by a high-fat diet.
""This is quite a breakthrough,"" he said. ""We had no idea they (the genes) were involved in obesity and Type 2 diabetes.
""Normally (the MNK genes) are not doing anything bad (in the body)... but testing in animal models found they were crucial to weight gain when a high-fat diet was consumed."" Prof Proud said the researchers found the MNK genes were responsible for making particular proteins in the body's cells which resulted in weight gain.

DPP probe into 'slapping therapy' death
The case of a seven-year-old diabetic boy who died after undergoing a ""slapping therapy"" workshop has been referred by police to the Department of Public Prosecutions.
Police and paramedics found Aidan Fenton unconscious and not breathing at the Ritz Hotel in Hurstville on April 30. He died at the scene.
The year 1 student, from Prospect in Sydney's west, had attended an $1800 Chinese therapy workshop at the Healthpac Medical Centre in Hurstville with his mother that week.
The workshop delivered slapping and stretching techniques administered by self-described ""healer"" Hongchi Xiao.
Aidan is believed to have had type 1 diabetes and police were investigating whether he had been taking insulin before his death.
St George Local Area Command crime manager Paul Simpkins said a brief of evidence had been referred to the DPP.
It is understood Aidan's parents, Geoff and Lily, were under investigation as well as Mr Xiao. None has been charged with an offence.
Mr Xiao, a Chinese national who left Australia in the days after Aidan's death, practises a form of therapy called ""PaidaLajin"" that he compares to yoga and tai chi.
He told Indian media in March that repeated slapping of the body caused heat, expanded blood vessels and the dissolving of toxins through a greater flow of chi.
""In each of my books and seminars, I have emphasised that I am not a doctor,"" Mr Xiao said in a message posted to Facebook days after Aidan's death.
In the same post, he linked to a ""strictly controlled study"" of PaidaLajin by an Indian hospital that tracked 25 people over five days.
""[Type 1 diabetes patients] recorded improvements in their clinical condition,"" the report said. ""However, during the healing crisis and fasting when their blood sugars went up [sic] their needed medical support in the form of calories, fluids and rapid action insulin to prevent ketoacidosis.""
Ketoacidosis is a serious medical emergency caused by a lack of insulin, according to Diabetes Australia.
None of the patients in the study was a child or an adolescent, the age groups most commonly affected by type 1 diabetes.
The Healthpac Medical Centre said at the time Mr Xiao ""rented a room from our centre to conduct what was described to us as a series of health seminars"".
The company said the boy and his mother had attended the workshop but Aidan had not been a patient of Healthpac. On Friday, the company said legal concerns prevented it from commenting.

Having given it their best shots, medals now honour their mettle
AUSTRALIAN DIABETES COUNCIL - 75 YEARS
Both Robert Gibson and Arthur MacPherson were just kids when they were diagnosed with type-1 diabetes in the 1930s. It was little more than a decade since insulin had been introduced as the life-saving treatment for diabetes, and the needles required to inject it were absurdly large. Syringes needed to be sterilised by boiling, as did the test tubes of urine samples that were required to test glucose levels.
It was a cumbersome but necessary routine that changed their previously carefree existence. Daily injections and a strict diet became part of their lives.
More than 75 years later, as both men prepare to receive a Kellion medal from the Australian Diabetes Council (ADC) - an honour bestowed on those who have lived with diabetes for more than 50 years - they recall that critical turning point in their youth.
MacPherson, 84, was nine when the disease was detected. ""I'd been wetting myself in class a lot, so the teacher sent a message home about it,"" he says, explaining that bedwetting and lapses in bladder control can often indicate diabetes.
Sure enough, tests revealed he had type-1 diabetes. With no known history of diabetes in the family, the diagnosis came as a shock.
According to ADC, type-1 diabetes is not related to lifestyle or consuming too much sugar; it is invariably traced to an inherited gene.
With little idea of how to manage the disease, the youngster was admitted to hospital, where he learnt how to inject himself with insulin and the diet he would need to follow for the rest of his life.
""It took me a while to get accustomed to what I had to do,"" recalls MacPherson, who has been married for 52 years and lives with wife Beryl in Lake Macquarie.
Two of their three children and one grandchild have type-1 diabetes, so there's an acute family awareness of the disease and how to manage it.
These days, the needles for injecting the insulin are minuscule in comparison with the horse needles once required, and there are simple devices for regularly testing blood-glucose levels. The strict diet, however, has remained a constant.
""I generally don't have sugar unless I need it and I have to work out what carbohydrates are in my food,"" says MacPherson, who has always relied on his wife to ""keep me on the straight and narrow"".
He usually requires an injection in the morning and evening before meals.
Robert Gibson, 91, knew exactly what was in store for him when he was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes at 13.
""I got it from my mother,"" says Gibson, who lives in an aged-care facility in Coffs Harbour with his wife, Henrietta, 90, who he similarly credits with strictly monitoring his diet throughout their 67-year marriage.
His grandmother, mother and one grandchild have type-1 diabetes. Their daughter has type-2 diabetes.
Sugar and starch have always been tightly rationed, which means favourites such as potatoes are a rare treat.
As part of the ADC's
75th-anniversary celebrations, both MacPherson and Gibson will soon receive a 75-year Kellion medal, adding to the Kellion medal collection they already have for living with diabetes.
More than 1.1 million Australians have diabetes, with rates increasing by about 7.2 per cent each year. The ADC expects that by 2018 about 2.65 million Australians will have diagnosable diabetes.
Apart from their permanently strict diets and assiduous monitoring of their blood-glucose levels, Gibson and MacPherson put a lot of their longevity down to two things: a positive attitude and their devoted spouses.
""I don't believe in stress; it's self-made,"" says Gibson, who now has his sights firmly set on a new milestone.
""I'm going to get to 100 and get my telegram from the Queen.""

Diabetic kids suffer bullying
ALMOST half of Australian children with type 1 diabetes feel bullied or excluded because of their disease, a study shows.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation study, which comes ahead of today's World Diabetes Day, found that many people felt ashamed because they had to inject insulin daily.
""My child feels uncomfortable in public and doesn't want everyone to know he has type 1 diabetes,"" one respondent wrote.
""My child is now an adult, but as a teenager we would do injections in the toilets, as she did not want others to see,"" another said.
Others believe people with diabetes should not be ashamed of their diagnosis, with one person stating: ""I feel that if you hide it, you are ashamed. There is nothing to be ashamed about. The more awareness there is, the more you can educate others."" Foundation chief executive Mike Wilson said he was concerned about social exclusion.
""The survey findings cement the negative and insensitive comments people with type 1 diabetes are so often subject to,"" he said.
""Negative experiences about type 1 diabetes, especially for children and teenagers, can have incredibly harmful effects on them and their disease management."" The survey found misconceptions about diabetes were: SUFFERERS bring it upon themselves by eating too much sugar. PEOPLE develop type 1 as a result of living an unhealthy lifestyle or by being overweight.
DIABETICS' parents gave them too many sweets as a child. Despite this, type 1 diabetes is a non-preventable disease and the cause is unknown.

Diabetic women at more risk
WOMEN with diabetes are almost 50 per cent more likely to have a heart attack than men with the condition, say researchers.
And they are nearly three times as likely to suffer any sort of heart problem than non-diabetic women.
Researchers analysed data from 64 studies spanning almost 50 years involving more than 850,000 people.
Experts are uncertain about reasons for the difference between the sexes, which could be down to men being treated more effectively.
Physiological differences including smaller blood vessels in women may be important, while newly diagnosed women tend to be more obese than men.
A systematic review of studies from 1966 to 2011 showed women with diabetes were 44 per cent more at risk of having a fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) incident than men with diabetes.
Women with diabetes were almost three times more likely to develop CHD compared with women without diabetes - a higher risk than for men with diabetes. Men with diabetes were only twice as likely to develop CHD than men without.

Health wrap diabetes Wallington
The Wallingtons certainly embrace the philosophy that managing a child with type 1 diabetes is a family effort.
Recognising this contribution of family is at the heart of the new Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre. Its symbol, an elephant, was chosen because these animals travel together in herds and take care of one another.
So it was fitting that 10-year-old Josh, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the start of last year, had an opportunity to get up close with Tricia the elephant at Perth Zoo recently.
""I was very excited to meet her,"" he said.
""She was pretty big and she blew air out of her trunk at my face. She knelt down and let me sit on her knee which was amazing but very scary at the same time.""
On hand to watch him interact with and feed the animal were his parents, Peter and Mandy, and 14-year-old sister Madeline, who wants to be a zoologist.
Mrs Wallington said she had an inkling over the summer holidays last year that Josh might have diabetes because he was drinking litres of water each day and had lost so much weight his ribs were showing.
""But the diagnosis still came as a huge shock.
""It affected us all,"" she said. ""We all grieved for the future we thought we had as a family and as individuals. It was all gone in an instant.
""Josh was the bravest kid I have ever seen. He was absolutely terrified of injections and needles. But within 24 hours, he was doing his own finger-prick tests.""
Josh has since adjusted well to his new routine, including being fitted last month with an insulin pump. ""Every day I need to make good decisions about my diabetes,"" he said.
""I have to balance what I eat and my exercise. I have to know how many carbohydrates are in my food so I can give myself the correct amount of insulin. I have to carry my testing kit everywhere I go.
""Sometimes my fingers get a bit sore because I have to prick my fingers and test my blood- glucose level before each meal.
""At the family centre, when I test my blood-sugar levels and have to count carbs for meals, I feel normal because other kids around me have to do the same thing. I don't have to explain how complicated diabetes is.""
Dealing with Josh's diabetes has also been a trial for the other family members, with a wealth of information to be absorbed.
""Leaving the hospital after that first week and having to be a doctor, a nurse, a dietitian, a diabetic educator, a psychologist and, most importantly, still a mum, dad and sister, it was overwhelming what we had to do to manage him properly,"" said Mrs Wallington, who sold her business so she could be available when needed.
""It takes a huge team effort. My husband and daughter came to all the information sessions so we could back each other up.""
For a school project, Madeline wrote a book about being diagnosed with diabetes.
""Diabetes makes family life a whole lot more stressful,"" Madeline said.
""We really can't relax, we are always worried. We have to plan for everything in advance. Mum and Dad are always pretty tired from testing Josh in the middle of the night.
""I wanted to get the message across in my book that life will throw obstacles at you and it may seem like the situation will never resolve but you can always work together to get through it.""
Mrs Wallington said one of Josh's earliest challenges was taking part in an overnight trek of the Bibbulmun Track with his Cub Scout group.
""We have realised we can still do what everyone else does - it just takes planning,"" she said.
The Canning Vale family have already seized on opportunities offered by the family centre. Mr Wallington has attended a Diabetes Dads meeting, while Madeline intends to do a Cooking for Teens class to learn healthy and nutritious recipes.
The entire family are also booked in for a three-night Nature Play Family Camp in Albany this month with other type 1 families.
""It's not that your friends and the rest of your family don't support you but they are not in the trenches with it every day,"" Mrs Wallington said. ""Before the centre, we did not know another single family with type 1 or a child our age. You really feel that you're alone.
""At the centre, it is like walking into a home - a home where we can find other families like ourselves. You don't have to sit in a waiting room, the kids are allowed to be kids, and you can make yourself a cuppa.
""The educators and the doctors can tell you the clinical side but it's the families who do it every day who can give practical advice about everyday questions. Like, how do you go swimming or what do you do when you go out for dinner, what do you do for sports day or a sleepover?
""The family centre is going to be awesome for things like that, for mums to connect, for dads to connect, for kids to look at other diabetic kids and see how they are injecting and testing and using a pump and seeing it's normal - they are not the odd one out.""

Diabetics warned of limb loss risk
TWELVE diabetics a day lose entire limbs and parts of their feet in largely preventable amputations, Diabetes Australia says.
Not only does the extreme surgical intervention reduce the quality and length of patient's lives, it is also a burden on the health system.
At least 85 per cent of amputations are preventable, but it's not as simple as diabetics checking their own feet, with reduced nerve sensation making it difficult for them to detect ulcers. Poor blood flow also means that for a diabetic, a stubbed toe or ulcer can quickly turn into a wound that may eventually require an amputation, Diabetes Australia CEO Greg Johnson said.
""It's a staggering number: 4400 amputations every year in Australia and that's just the tip of the iceberg... there are also more than 10,000 admissions to hospitals for diabetic foot problems,"" he said. However amputations could be reduced or even eliminated if the fragmented system was replaced by a national system that included checks and earlier treatment.

POLICE are investigating whether traditional Chinese medicine treatments from a southwestern Sydney medical centre may have contributed to the death of a seven-year-old boy with diabetes.
The Prospect boy died on Monday night after paramedics were called to the Hurstville Ritz Hotel, where he had been staying with his parents.
The boy was unconscious when paramedics arrived about 9pm. He died of cardiac arrest on the way to hospital.
Hotel staff said they had rushed to the family's room after hearing screaming. ""It's been very upsetting for everyone,"" a staff member said. Detectives on Tuesday removed computers, iPads and business records from the offices of the Tasly Healthpac Medical Centre, a short distance from the Ritz Hotel.

Tasly Healthpac Medical Centre staff would not say what treatments the boy had been given.

Obese kids lose tonsils Doctors take drastic measures as childhood weight issues soar
SOME Aussie kids are growing so fat that surgeons are having to remove their tonsils to help them breathe.
Overweight children as young as 10 are developing diabetes that normally afflicts the middle-aged.
And medical specialists are treating 36kg ""waddling"" toddlers for obesity.
The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) wants parents to fight that flab by offering healthier food and making children do more exercise.
Its new draft obesity guidelines recommend ""weight maintenance"" - instead of weight loss - for fat children.
But one of the nation's three specialist centres for treating childhood obesity, the Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney, has warned the NHMRC that some are so obese they must lose weight through meal plans and exercise.
Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton said some parents do not even notice their children are overweight.
""There's a new norm once you get 25 per cent of children and 60 per cent of adults obese,"" he said. ""They look in the mirror and think they don't look too bad.""
Westmead's paediatric obesity staff specialist, Dr Shirley Alexander, said the hospital was treating toddlers as young as 18 months.
Some two-year-olds were 36kg - three times the recommended body weight - and waddled, not walked.
Dr Alexander said some seven and eight-year-olds had their tonsils removed to help them breathe.
And young children had been given hip operations because they were so heavy their joints gave out.
""We've got five, six and seven-year-olds with insulin resistance and 10-year-olds with type 2 diabetes,"" Dr Alexander said.
""Thirty years ago you didn't see that until people were in their 40s and 50s.""
He said society had become ""obesogenic"" as ""bigger is more the norm now"".
The draft NHMRC guidelines state that excessive physical activity is thought to be detrimental to normal growth for kids.
But the Children's Hospital warns the statement is ""misleading and could potentially discourage patients from activity and cause anxiety to parents"".

Type 1 diabetes accounts for 10-15 per cent of all people with diabetes and usually occurs in people under 30. There is no cure. Classified as an autoimmune condition, where the body's defence system is triggered to attack healthy tissue, type 1 diabetes attacks the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin and slowly destroys them.
Insulin replacement therapy is critical and should be combined with physical activity, healthy eating and stress management to avoid or reduce the short and long-term complications of diabetes.
People are born either with or without one of the 13 genes that cause type 1 diabetes. Those without the gene can still develop type 2 diabetes.
Signs and symptoms include:
Thirst
Frequent urination
Lethargy or being very tired
Blurred vision
Sudden weight loss
Infections or wounds that don't improve

Vitamin K diabetes trial a world first
WA diabetes patients are being recruited into a world-first trial to see if vitamin K can help stop them having heart attacks and strokes.
It is part of a double-barrelled study by Royal Perth Hospital of treatments that could switch off dangerous hardening of the arteries, a leading cause of sickness and death in diabetics.
The pilot study is the first to focus on turning off microcalcification activity to stop the build-up of calcium in the arteries.
Doctors will give diabetics vitamin K and the anti-inflammatory medicine colchicine, which is commonly used to treat gout, a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the blood.
They will also see if nuclear-based PET scans can detect microscopic calcium activity many months before deposits can be detected in the arteries.
More than 100,000 West Australians have diabetes, which occurs if the body cannot produce enough effective insulin to convert glucose into energy, leaving too much sugar in the blood.
University of WA chair of cardiology Carl Schultz said the RPH trial was cutting edge. Diabetics were at more risk of hardened arteries but some had other risk factors such as being overweight or having high blood pressure and cholesterol.
""We think vitamin K and colchicine have complementary effects, by reducing inflammation and enhancing the body's natural defence against hardening of the arteries,"" Professor Schultz said.
""So far the only treatment to reduce hardening of the arteries has been lowering cholesterol, but while that cuts back the risk of heart attack, it seems to have absolutely no effect on calcification.
""People still have heart attacks despite being on cholesterol lowering treatment, so we've got to find new ways that work better.""
Professor Schultz said heart disease was Australia's number one killer and the incidence of diabetes was rising.
Using PET scans to check for early calcium activity would allow doctors to intervene much earlier for those found to be at risk.
""Once calcium is in the arteries we cannot get it out, it's an irreversible process, but detecting activity before it is there allows us to retrieve the process,"" Professor Schultz said.

Health wrap diabetes Hayes
For Michelle and Dan Hayes, Australia Day 2015 does not hold happy memories.
That was the day their then 10-month-old son, Jack, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes after an exhausting flight from Sydney.
""A few days before flying back to Perth, Jack started leaking through his nappies to the point of a big puddle on the floor and drinking two big cups of water within a few hours,"" Mrs Hayes said.
""Sydney was very humid so I put it down to that but also, mother's instinct, I googled 'diabetes in 10 month old' and, sure enough, there were chat forums online about this.""
Despite others waving away her concerns and with her husband away at a cycling event in Adelaide, Mrs Hayes grew more worried as Jack became pale, lethargic and sleepy. He didn't want to eat and had bouts of vomiting.
When Mr Hayes met them at Perth Airport, it hit home how sick Jack was.
""When I looked at my little man, who was normally vibrant and full of life, the poor thing looked like death,"" he said. ""He was sheet white, sad, no smile for his dad, not even any movement at all.""
The family headed straight to hospital and insisted on having Jack's blood-sugar levels tested. As confirmation came that Jack had type 1 diabetes and was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis - a life-threatening condition that requires treatment with insulin and fluids, the shock and emotions set in.
""Michelle broke down into tears and straight away blamed herself and started to ask why,"" Mr Hayes said. ""I was gutted, sad, and at the same time relieved that we could now get on with fixing or managing him.""
Now nearly six months later, the Stirling couple have worked as a team to adjust to caring for a diabetic child, thanks also to a supportive family and understanding boss.
""We are very organised people anyway so this has just slipped into our daily routine,"" Mrs Hayes said, adding that regular phone calls with the diabetes educators at PMH helped considerably.
With the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre nearby, the Hayes family cycled to it recently to see the facilities.
""The centre is a breath of fresh air and is a valuable resource for us and to the other families,"" Mrs Hayes said. ""The events, programs and play area are going to provide Jack with a second family and a network for us to build upon. The centre makes me excited to show other families we are all in this together and once you step into those doors there is no judgment.""
Mrs Hayes admits finger-prick testing and Jack's insulin pump have drawn stares.
""People have asked if Jack is wearing a mobile phone,"" she said. ""Those looks did make me uncomfortable as I feel like I was being judged, but now I'm going to embrace it. I'd prefer people ask me what Jack is wearing because I find it helps me explain what diabetes is.""

Drinking wine three times a week 'cuts diabetes'
Drinking ""little and often"" during the week could lower the risk of diabetes. A study found men who drank three to four times a week cut their odds of Type 2 diabetes by 27 per cent, compared with those who drank less than one day a week. The reduction was almost a third for women. Researchers questioned more than 70,500 participants about their drinking habits over an average of 4.9 years.
Results were adjusted to reflect factors such as weight, diet and family history of diabetes. Men who had just over nine pints of beer a week cut their odds of Type 2 diabetes by 43 per cent compared with those who did not drink at all.
For women, those who drank the equivalent of just over a bottle-and-a-half of wine a week were found to have a 58 per cent lower risk. The polyphenols in red wine grapes are believed to help control blood sugar and the Danish study found beer may also protect against diabetes. But gin and vodka almost doubled the risk, according to the study in the journal Diabetologia.

Are you on the road to diabetes?
Diabetes is the fastest-growing chronic health problem plaguing Aussies, yet many of us wouldn't know how to spot if we were at risk of the deadly disease, discovers Rosie King One Australian is diagnosed with diabetes every five minutes. Of those, 85-95 per cent will be diagnosed with type 2, a condition that's both deadly and preventable.
Sof Andrikopoulos, CEO of the Australian Diabetes Society, describes type 1 and type 2 diabetes as diseases of the pancreas, in which the pancreas is unable to secrete enough insulin to regulate the glucose levels in our blood.
""With type 1, the immune system actually kills the cells that produce insulin so there's a complete deficiency. With type 2, the insulin-producing cells don't work efficiently so there's a relative deficiency."" Type 2 used to typically affect men and women who were over 55. That's all changed now, Andrikopoulos says: ""When I started in diabetes research 25 years ago, you had to be over 55 to get type 2 but now we're seeing it in young adults, adolescents and even in children under 10. It all comes down to our lifestyle - the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes are obese."" To stop type 2 diabetes taking hold, be aware of signs that might indicate a fast-track to diagnosis. Left undiagnosed and untreated, type 2 diabetes can lead to illness, amputation, even death.
SIGNS YOU'RE AT RISK If any of these ring true, now's the time to act. Talk to your GP or health care professional EXPANDING WAISTLINE ""Waist circumference is strongly linked with diabetes risk,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If you're a man and your waistline is 102cm or above or you're a woman with a waist circumference of 88cm or higher, that's a very telling sign you could be heading down the path towards diabetes.
""Measuring your waist is easy, too. Just grab a measuring tape and wrap it around your belly. If it measures more than it should, it's a good idea to see someone about managing your weight, because as well as diabetes, you could be at risk of developing heart disease."" BAD DIET ""A poor diet will accelerate your progression to type 2 diabetes but little tweaks can go a long way,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""Cutting down the number of sugary drinks you have or how many sugars you put in your coffee every day can mean a big reduction in your discretionary kilojoule intake. Over six months, the benefits of that are huge."" It's a case of minimising the amount of treat foods you have now, so that you don't have to give them up forever.
""Once you've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, diet is critical to managing it properly,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""That means saying goodbye to all excessive kilojoules - the burgers, the pizza, the soft drinks. It all has to go."" It's not just about avoiding certain foods, it's also a matter of eating enough fruit, veg, nuts, wholegrains and fish, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE ""Just as exercise improves insulin resistance, a lack of activity makes it harder for those insulin-producing cells to do their job, which accelerates the development of diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says.
""You don't have to run a marathon or lift 100kg at the gym every day but you do need to move regularly. Walking for 30 minutes every day is a cheap and easy way to give your body what it needs and minimise the risk."" FAMILY HISTORY ""If one of your parents has type 2 diabetes, your likelihood of developing it rises by 30 per cent,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""If both parents have type 2 diabetes, that number jumps to 70 per cent. We can't control our genes or our parents but we can control other risk factors.
""If you have a family history of diabetes, be vigilant about being active, ensure your weight is in a healthy range, don't smoke and don't drink excessively. That's my advice to anyone, regardless of their history.""

SIGNS YOU'RE IN TROUBLE These symptoms of type 2 diabetes require immediate attention FREQUENT TOILET VISITS ""Going to the toilet more than twice a night is a reasonably good indicator of type 2 diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""Once your glucose levels reach a certain concentration in your blood, your kidneys start excreting the glucose in your urine so you'll need to go more often."" EXCESSIVE THIRST ""If you're going to the toilet a lot, you're losing a significant amount of water in your urine, which leads to excessive thirst,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""But that doesn't have to be the case. Too much glucose in the blood can also flick the thirst switch in the brain so you'll continuously feel as though you need to be glugging down glasses of water."" SENSITIVE SKIN ""When glucose levels are too high, our infection-fighting white blood cells don't work properly so skin irritations can be slow to heal,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""You might notice a rash that's hard to get rid of or a wound that takes an unusually long time to heal. This shows your immune system is weak, which could mean your diabetes risk is elevated."" BLURRED VISION AND NUMBNESS ""I'd expect you to have every other symptom as well because if it's come to the stage of blurred vision and numb fingertips, you have out-of-control diabetes,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""Put the newspaper down and get to your doctor quick-smart.""
What about fatigue? ""Fatigue is a big but difficult one,"" Andrikopoulos says. ""With diabetes, your cells aren't working effectively or efficiently to secrete enough insulin, which can wreak havoc on your immune system and energy levels. It can be difficult to know what's causing a person's fatigue because it's a symptom of so many medical conditions - and our busy lives - but it's something to be mindful of if you're concerned about diabetes.""

Super-sized problem
Have you heard the word bariatric? I've started noticing it a lot recently, but if you worked in health care you would hear it every day. In the medical world bariatrics is big business, and getting bigger, simply because we are. We are going barrel shaped and eating and wobbling our way to early graves.
The term bariatric was first used in the mid-1960s when Americans started to really pack on the pounds. They lived in a world of excess with access to mountains of cheap fast food they could wash down with rivers of soft drink. Couple this with television watching, motorised transport, and less and less exercise and you have the perfect prescription for supersized people dying from diabetes.
In the medical world paediatric refers to children, geriatric refers to old people and bariatric refers to grossly overweight people - people we used to call really fat. I don't know if you can use the word fat these days because it seems to be so out of favour. We are encouraged to say obese for fat and morbidly obese for really fat. But whatever way we say it, we know what we are talking about. We are getting fatter and fatter.
Stomach banding and other bariatric surgical techniques were developed to save overeaters from their addiction to food.
It's booming not just in the US but all over the world.
Around 10 per cent of Americans have weight-related diabetes. In Australia the rate is around 5 per cent but that has tripled in the past 25 years so we are not far behind. It's going to be the biggest health issue facing us in the future.
In China there are 100 million people with diabetes, in India there are 60 million, and it's a similar story in other developing countries where they've embraced western fast food and lifestyles. Super-sized Australians are causing problems in every area of society. I recently flew on a plane where the person in front of me was so large he could not fit properly into the seat and he almost broke it when he pushed back on it. He would have been close to 200kg.
The bariatric equipment suppliers now make special beds, chairs, toilet seats and more for people who weigh up to 300kg.
They can barely keep up with demand.
But out of all this despair there's hope. Some remarkable medical research in the US has shown that up to 80 per cent of grossly overweight people who undergo bariatric surgery have their diabetes disappear. This is extraordinary as there is no known cure for Type 2 diabetes. A recent study in Newcastle, NSW, where nearly three quarters of the adult population is overweight or obese has shown similar results.
I have sympathy for people who have ""weight issues"". I used to be as skinny as a rake but I've put on about 25kg in the past 25 years. If I keep this up I will be pre-diabetic or a diabetic in need of bariatric surgery myself in 25 years' time.
In the meantime I'm trying to ward off that prospect by following the latest fad diet of fasting two days a week and feeding normally for five. I am also following an exercise regime where you go flat out for a minute or so on an exercise bike and then have a rest, and do this for just a few minutes a day. It seems to be working as I have lost a kilo in a week.
But if I fail to lose the weight I can rest easy as I also discovered another study that reported that when they studied a mixed weight group of 50 year olds and followed them until they died it was the overweight ones who remained overweight who outlived those who were normal weight who remained normal weight. And apart from those who were very obese who became more obese those most likely to die were the normal weight participants who lost weight.
There have been dozens of studies that show that overweight people tend to live longer. So maybe the best thing to do if you are not really fat is do a bit of exercise, enjoy good healthy food and enjoy life. Now that's not a bad New Year's resolution!

Familiar face helps drive blood sugar levels lower
DIABETES is Australia's fastest growing chronic health condition, and the NT is its epicentre, but one small Territory community is beginning to turn the tide against the preventable disease.
A focused effort by health workers at the town's clinic has brought the average blood sugar levels of many of Pine Creek's diabetics down dramatically.
About 10 per cent of Pine Creek residents have type 2 diabetes and clinic nurse Richard Parry said persistency was key in getting the message across.
""It took quite a long time to get trust from people and being a familiar face definitely helps,"" he said. ""I can remember a time when it all seemed pretty hard but being persistent, we've managed to break down some of those barriers that seemed to be there."" One of the biggest factors in improving outcomes for diabetics was recruiting local man Rodney Balmana as an ambulance driver.
A diabetic himself, Mr Balmana uses his status in the community to encourage others to keep their appointments and make good lifestyle choices. ""Because he's a local, people can't hide from him and he doesn't let them hide,"" nurse Sylvia Dean said.

Diabetes trial success
Biotechnology Mesoblast eyes pharmaceutical deals
Mesoblast has added another big potential revenue generator to its arsenal after an early trial for one of its stem cell therapies improved the health of patients suffering from diabetes-related kidney disease.
The Melbourne-based biotech company aired the trial results at the 75th meeting of the American Diabetes Association in Boston and will announce them to the market on Tuesday.
Mesoblast chief executive and founder Silviu Itescu said diabetic nephropathy, the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, was ""a huge unmet medical need"".
""In Australia there has been a five-fold increase in patients on dialysis in the last five years or so. It is a huge healthcare burden and it is growing,"" he said.
Between 40 and 50 per cent of all type 2 diabetics will develop kidney disease and there were almost 2 million cases of advanced diabetic nephropathy in 2013, he said.
Over a 24-week phase 2 trial patients who received a single infusion of Mesoblast's mesenchymal precursor cell (MPC) product candidate MPC-300-IV suffered no adverse side effects and demonstrated improved kidney function.
The positive findings add another candidate to Mesoblast's list of potential blockbuster adult stem cell treatments.
The company has five candidates in the crucial, and final, phase 3 program stage. But it is still burning cash as it waits for its heavy research and development spending to turn into proven and approved revenue earners.
At its interim result in February Mesoblast said it had burned through $47.2 million of its cash reserves during the half-year, leaving $149.2 million of cash in the bank.
In April Mesoblast sold 4.5 per cent of its shares to American pharmaceutical heavyweight Celgene for $58.5 million.
Mr Itescu said more deals were in the works as the company looked for partners with the sales and distribution capabilities to take drugs to market.
""We've got strategic partners in cardiovascular and recently had an injection of capital by Celgene and I would suggest that several of our other candidates will be partnered,"" he said.
""I think in the short term and I would expect in the next few months.""
Mesoblast's MSC-100-IV product, which is awaiting regulatory approval in Japan, treats a common complication of cancer therapy called graft-versus-host disease and would probably deliver sales later in 2015, he said.
""There are a number [of candidates] in phase 3 now. This is how long it takes to bring a drug to market. It takes about 10 years from discovery to commercialisation.
""These are not small markets. These are $2 billion to $3 billion markets for each product.""
Mr Itescu owns 20 per cent, $266 million worth, of Mesoblast.
Its shares have fallen 12 per cent over the past 12 months, while the market has risen 0.5 per cent.
Biotech stocks are notoriously volatile and can be extremely sensitive to clinical trial results.
Shareholders in liver cancer therapy group Sirtex Medical have been on a roller-coaster ride in 2015 after huge market reactions to its trial results.
On June 1 the stock surged 14 per cent on the back of strong positive comments from researchers about Sirtex's treatment.

Schoolyard taunts add to torment
University student April Welsh remembers being taunted in the schoolyard for having a chocolate bar or can of soft drink.
Other children knew she had type 1 diabetes but some thought she had brought the condition on herself by eating sugary foods.
""What they didn't realise was that often I was having the chocolate or soft drink to save my life, to stop me going into a coma,"" Ms Welsh said.
""I constantly had to give other kids a lesson in diabetes, particularly the difference between type 1 and type 2.""
The 20-year-old said many misconceptions surrounded diabetes, and some children ""nitpicked"" her at school, making her feel uncomfortable about asking to leave the classroom to check her blood sugar levels.
A survey by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has found that almost half of people with type 1 diabetes face bullying or exclusion from activities.
Chief executive Mike Wilson said it was concerning that 46 per of people with type 1 diabetes had experienced some form of social exclusion.
""The survey findings cement the negative and insensitive comments people with type 1 are so often subjected to,"" he said.
""These negative experiences about type 1 diabetes, especially for children and teenagers, can have incredibly harmful effects on them.""
Common misunderstandings of type 1 diabetes were that people brought it on themselves by eating too much sugar or the person's parents must have given them too many sweets as a child.

Millions of Australians on cusp of full-blown diabetes 
MORE than two million adult Australians are on the verge of developing diabetes and related health problems unless they change their lifestyles.
About 1.7 million Australians already suffer diabetes, but a higher number are pre-diabetic, with high blood-glucose levels putting them at the edge of the full-blown disease.
New research from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, however, shows it is not too late for most to avoid severe health issues through intensive early interventions.
The research, to be discussed at the World Diabetes Congress in Melbourne from Monday, shows that pre-diabetics are able to cut their chances of progressing to full diabetes by more than half within three years by overhauling their diet and lifestyle.
""Eating a healthy diet with the aim of losing weight and doing regular exercise makes this big difference of a 60 per cent reduction in the chances of developing diabetes,"" the institute's Associate Professor Jonathan Shaw said.
""If they do nothing and progress to diabetes, they face all the issues that go along with that; eye disease, foot disease, kidney problems, the likely need for extra medication."" More than two million Australians over 25 are pre-diabetic, making them 15 times more likely to suffer diabetes than those with normal blood glucose levels.

Ignorant on dangers of diabetes 
AUSTRALIANS are dangerously ignorant of the dangers of type 2 diabetes, despite rates of the chronic disease tipped to triple by the year 2031.
An Australian Medicines Industry report, out today, surveyed 5000 Australians aged 32-66 about their opinions on health and disease.
It found 90 per cent of those surveyed did not consider the condition to be a major health concern.
The report also found 42 per cent of respondents did not exercise regularly - a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes.
""There is a clear disconnect between our views on health, particularly in relation to weight and the implications of that in regard to serious and potentially life-threatening disease,"" industry spokesman Dr Brendan Shaw said.
He said while Australians were aware of the messages of healthy eating and exercise, the long-term consequences of obesity were not well understood in the community.
""A staggering 65 per cent of all cardiovascular deaths occur in people with diabetes or pre-diabetes.""
Every day, about 280 Australians develop diabetes, the report says.
Australians were more willing to modify their diet than exercise to improve health, with 62 per cent saying they would eat more fruit and vegetables and 57 per cent would reduce their consumption of fat.
However, only 38 per cent would exercise regularly and 25 per cent would reduce alcohol intake.
Lyell McEwin Hospital head of diabetes and endocrinology services Dr Elaine Pretorius said the report's findings were ""extremely worrying"".
""There is a belief that obesity 'won't happen to me' and I think people believe that being overweight is not an issue, and diabetes is not an issue when it clearly has significant consequences,"" she said.
Complications of type 2 diabetes include heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and amputations.
Dr Pretorius said the report found cancer was the most feared disease among Australians, but few people were aware that obesity was a risk factor for certain types of cancer.
""The biggest gift we can give our children as parents is to make healthy eating changes and regular exercise part of their lives,"" she said.
""Otherwise, trying to change those habits suddenly at the age of 60 is going to be very hard.""

Sugar study not so sweet
SUGAR Nazis rejoice - a new study shows every sugar-sweetened drink you give up each day will cut your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 14 to 25 per cent.
And sweetened milk drinks like milkshakes have emerged as a greater enemy than the much-maligned soft drinks in type 2 diabetes risk.
But tea, coffee and juice drinkers can take heart because it turns out some sweetened drinks are better than others. Soft drinks, cordials and sweetened milk contribute to higher type 2 diabetes risk while sweetened coffee and tea and fruit juice do not.
A Cambridge University study published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, found replacing a serving of soft drinks with a serving of water or unsweetened tea or coffee, cuts the risk of diabetes by 14 per cent.
But surprisingly, replacing a serving of sweetened milk beverage with water or unsweetened tea or coffee cuts your diabetes risk by between 20 and 25 per cent. Researchers studied the impact of sweetened drinks on more than 25,000 men and women aged 40-79 living in the UK.
Study participants recorded everything that they ate and drank for seven consecutive days, and over 11 years 847 study participants were diagnosed with new cases of type 2 diabetes. Every time you increase your consumption of sweet drinks by 5 per cent of your total energy intake, you increase your risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 18 per cent, the study found.
If sweet beverage consumers reduced their intake to below 2 per cent of their total energy intake, 15 per cent of incident diabetes might be prevented, the research found.
The study also questioned research showing artificially sweetened beverages can also increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.
While there was an association between consumption of artificially sweetened soft drinks and type 2 diabetes, the diabetes risk became insignificant when this was adjusted for the patient's weight.
""The positive association of artificially sweetened beverages and type 2 diabetes may be an artefact of reverse causality where those who are overweight or obese and at higher risk of chronic disease consume a higher amount of artificially sweetened beverages than those at lower risk,"" the authors found.
Public health advocates have long been calling for higher taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages to stem the obesity epidemic in Western countries.

WHAT IS DIABETES?
There are two types of diabetes but both are caused by different factors and affect different people. Diabetes WA acting manager of the Diabetes Management Unit Sophie McGough said to understand diabetes it was important to understand insulin.
""Insulin is a substance that is made by the body's pancreas. It helps keep the muscles inside our body healthy by acting like a key to let the good stuff in and keep the bad stuff out,"" Ms McGough said.
Glucose comes from the food people eat and is one of the good things insulin lets in the body.
Ms McGough said glucose was similar to the fuel put into a car.
""Just like you put fuel in your car to make it go, our body needs glucose to make it work properly,"" Ms McGough said.
""Not having insulin would be like leaving the fuel cap on your car when you're trying to fill it up.
""No glucose would get inside and you wouldn't get very far.""
If someone has type 1 diabetes their pancreas has stopped being able to make insulin.
""We still don't know exactly why this happens,"" Ms McGough said. ""The body can't work without insulin, so people with type 1 diabetes have to inject insulin.""
If a person has type 2 diabetes their body can still make insulin but it's like a rusty key in a rusty lock and does not work very well.
""We know these rusty locks happen for lots of different reasons like your genetics, how healthily you eat, how much exercise you do,"" Ms McGough said.
""People with type 2 diabetes try and help these rusty locks by eating healthily and doing exercise and taking diabetes tablets.
""Sometimes the insulin and locks get so rusty, people with type 2 diabetes have to inject more insulin.""
Ms McGough said it was important to remember the cause of type 1 diabetes had nothing to do with eating too much sugar.
""There is currently no prevention or cure for type 1 diabetes, it's not caused by eating sugar,"" she said.
""But people with type 1 diabetes are super clever at knowing how much insulin they need to inject to match the food they have eaten.""
Ms McGough said the more sugar a person had eaten, the more insulin they would need but matching it could sometimes be tricky.
""If a person hasn't eaten enough or they've done lots of exercise, there is not enough glucose left over for the insulin to share with the brain, and the brain chucks a tantrum,"" Ms McGough said.
""This is when a low blood glucose (incident) is happening and they'll need sugar fast.""
HOW MUCH IS OK?
Dietitian Gael Myers said The World Health Organisation suggested kids keep ""free sugars"" to less than 10 per cent of their total energy intake for the day.
""Free sugars are all sugars added to food during manufacturing, cooking, or preparing, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juice,"" Ms Myers, from healthy eating program Crunch&Sip, said.
""Sugars that are natural in milk, whole fruits and vegetables don't count.""
Ms Myers said this meant kids could eat about 7-14 teaspoons of free sugars per day.
""A five-year-old should aim to be at the lowest end of the range, while a 17-year-old can have up to the highest end of the range,"" Ms Myers said.
Most fruits have between five and 15g of sugar per 100g.
""One or two small pieces of fruit are about 150g of sugar but the natural sugar is packaged with important nutrients like fibre, vitamins and minerals,"" Ms Myers said.
""Their nutrients provide heaps of health benefits to your body. Fibre also fills you up which means it's harder to overeat fruit than chocolate.""

Express tick for diabetes 
WOMEN with diabetes can safely express breast milk in late pregnancy to give to their baby, according to world-first findings by Melbourne researchers.
Around one in 10 women will develop diabetes during pregnancy, putting their baby at risk of developing potentially dangerous hypoglycaemia (low blood-sugar levels) after birth.
Anita Moorhead, La Trobe University co-researcher and senior lactation consultant at the Royal Women's Hospital, said breast milk stabilised a baby's blood sugar levels more effectively than infant formula, but many women with diabetes experienced a delay in their milk coming in.
""Our study found that when women express from 36-37 weeks of pregnancy, most will produce milk ahead of their birth and are then able to provide that extra milk if needed once their baby is born,"" Ms Moorhead said.
Despite concerns that the practice was unsafe, the research - conducted by the university, Royal Women's Hospital and Mercy Hospital for Women on more than 600 Victorian women - found antenatal expressing didn't harm babies. The findings, published in The Lancet, mean doctors and midwives will now be able to recommend that low-risk pregnant women with diabetes express and store milk to give to their newborn if required.

Diabetes is blinding thousands
TENS of thousands of Australians are going blind as a result of the nation's fastest growing disease diabetes.
And most are failing to take regular eye tests that could prevent it.
Sixty per cent of people with type 2 diabetes will develop eye disease within 20 years of diagnosis and it will affect all people with type 1 diabetes, a Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute report has found.
It says people with diabetes have a 25 times greater risk of blindness than the general population.
In the past 10 years 10,000 Australians went blind as a result of diabetes and another 300,000 have diabetic retinopathy, which makes it difficult to read and watch television.
About a million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and another 700,000 are believed to have the disease but do not know it.
Tasmania has one of the worst rates of diabetes in Australia with about 22,000 people with type 2 diabetes and 3000 with type 1.
""With the number of Australians affected by diabetes expected to double in the next decade... diabetic eye disease is creating significant personal, public health and economic challenges,"" Associate Professor Jonathan Shaw of the Baker IDI Institute said.
Diabetic retinopathy occurs when the tiny blood vessels inside the retina at the back of the eye are damaged as a result of diabetes. It can have a devastating effect, robbing victims of their independence, preventing them from reading, socialising and driving.
The Centre for Eye Research in Australia says 50 per cent of people with diabetes are not having regular biannual eye checks to test for retinopathy.
""Australia lacks a nationwide diabetic eye screening system, even though such systems have been (successful) in other countries with significant improvements in outcomes for those with diabetic retinopathy,"" Dr Mohamed Dirani, from CERA, said.
Diabetic retinopathy may have no early symptoms and it worsens over time and can lead to irreversible blindness.
Vision loss can be prevented by regular eye checks and medical treatment.
Tania Withers, of Melbourne, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was 11 and struggled to manage her condition as a teenager.
""At 23 my eyesight started deteriorating and I was diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy,"" she said. ""I felt so guilty because I had not attended regular eye examinations, despite being warned by doctors and diabetes educators.""

""The findings of this study indicate that switching to a low GI diet during pregnancy and lactation has the potential to have lasting benefits for the metabolic health outcomes of the offspring, and reduce their risk of obesity and diabetes later in life,"" lead researcher Dr Beverly Muhlhausler from the University of Adelaide said.
""We are particularly excited about this research because low-GI diets have already been shown to be safe for pregnant women. If we can get the (low-GI) message out there, we have a real opportunity to improve the health of future generations.""

New findings aid diabetes therapy push
THOUSANDS of children with type 1 diabetes are missing out on technology that not only spares them daily injections but also debilitating side effects.
Insulin pump therapy gives the correct dose direct into the abdomen without injections but, as it is means tested, only those with a health care card or privately insured can get the $9000 device.
In a major Australian study of almost 1000 diabetic adolescents, insulin pump therapy has been proved to reduce retinopathy - a precursor to vision loss and blindness - and peripheral nerve damage, which can lead to gangrene. Both are complications of diabetes.
Westmead Children's Hospital specialist and co-author of the study Maria Craig, from the Institute of Endocrinology and Diabetes, said the findings would change the way people managed diabetes but means testing meant children from average families would miss out.
""People with diabetes never achieve completely normal blood sugar levels but you can get better control with the pump,"" Professor Craig said.
""The pump reduces the highs and lows, and reducing the variability is the key to less complications."" There are 118,000 Australians with type 1 diabetes. In the past year more than 3021 cases were registered. Only 12 per cent have accessed insulin pump therapy. Of the 7000 children with type 1 diabetes, only half can access the pump.
""Private health covers it or if you are on a low income with a health care card but that leaves a huge number of kids who miss out,"" Prof Craig said. Earlier attempts to get the pumps covered were knocked back on the grounds of lack of evidence, but this latest study shows the pumps can reduce complications therefore saving on ambulance use, emergency department presentations and hospital admissions.

Cholesterol key in fight on diabetes 
AUSTRALIAN researchers will artificially raise levels of ""good"" cholesterol in diabetics in a first human trial aiming to stop patients with ""pre-diabetes"" progressing to the full-blown disease.
While the link between heart disease, stroke and cholesterol has long been known, researchers are starting to uncover that ""good"" HDL cholesterol may also protect against diabetes.
Almost a quarter of Australian adults have diabetes or the impaired glucose metabolism condition known as ""pre-diabetes"".
Heart disease and stroke are the biggest complications for diabetes. Now the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne has joined an international race to find a new ""good"" cholesterol-raising drug as the first treatment for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
The head of Baker IDI's Metabolic and Vascular Physiology Laboratory, Prof Bronwyn Kingwell, said diabetes upset the balance between the protective HDL particles, which scavenge artery-clogging fats deposited by ""bad"" LDL cholesterol particles.
""People don't die of diabetes, they die of heart disease. They get complications in the blood vessels of their eyes, heart and brain,"" Prof Kingwell said.
""We have good drugs to lower LDL cholesterol, but we don't have drugs that can raise 'good' cholesterol effectively."" The proof-of-concept study will use the experimental drug RVX-208 to raise HDL levels in 20 patients by just 5-10 per cent over four weeks.
Prof Kingwell said the drug produced high-quality ""good"" cholesterol. These new HDL particles may help improve glucose control for diabetics through their effects on pancreatic cells and muscle, the body's major sites for using glucose. This has the potential to prevent or delay the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes.
The research follows a breakthrough five years ago that found ""good"" cholesterol could be used to control blood sugar by imitating the effect of exercise on muscles.
""This is an out-of-the-box new angle,"" Prof Kingwell said.
""Muscle is the major site of glucose disposal in the body.
""In diabetics, the glucose builds up in the blood because the patient becomes resistant to the actions of insulin, which normally moves glucose from the blood and into muscle."" The study has been supported by a $500,000 National Health and Medical Research Council grant.

Now parents can sleep safe
PARENTS will no longer have to worry about their diabetic kids dying through the night with the Government today announcing free continuous glucose monitoring kits for children and teens under the age of 21.
The $54 million dollar announcement will see a sticker placed on the skin of a child or young person with diabetes to estimate blood glucose levels.
Alerts will be sent to parents' smartphones when their child's glucose levels become concerning and they can administer insulin immediately.
Currently, continuous glucose monitoring kits cost up to $4000 a year but, from tomorrow, they will be available to eligible families for free.
There are 15,000 child and teen type 1 diabetics sufferers in Australia; however, it is estimated around 4000 will access the new program.
Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease that attacks a person's ability to produce insulin.
Children and young people with the disease have to monitor their glucose levels around the clock.
It's estimated around 10 Australians with type 1 diabetes die each year overnight due to complications relating to their disease.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said continuous glucose monitoring would save lives and also reduce the hassle of the daily finger-prick for diabetics.
""While the finger-prick method is effective and accurate, it can be quite a difficult and upsetting process for some children and their parents, with up to 10 tests needed every day - including several times every night,"" Mr Hunt said.
""This will be life-changing for children, young people and their families."" Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said today's announcement would massively ease the burden for families with children suffering from type 1 diabetes.
""It is hard to overstate the significance of this,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It will literally change lives and save lives in thousands of Australian families where children and young people have type 1 diabetes."" Mr Johnson said that, for parents, the burden of having a young child with type 1 diabetes was enormous and many didn't sleep well at night for fear their children would suffer hypoglycaemia - dangerously low blood glucose that can lead to unconsciousness or even death.
""We have parents telling us that they haven't slept for 10 years because they lie awake every night worrying if their child would have hypoglycaemia and lose consciousness,"" he said.
Parents who think that their children will benefit from a continuous glucose monitoring kit should consult with an authorised health professional, who will assess their need and offer advice. Eligibility assessment forms will be available to download at www.ndss.com.au

Diabetes lifts risk of cancers, group warns
A WA diabetes research group is warning of the disease's emerging link to cancer, with diabetics facing as much as a 70 per cent higher risk of some cancers.
Diabetes Research WA said studies suggested people with diabetes had more risk of breast, bowel, pancreatic, liver and bladder cancers. Increased rates of diabetes could accelerate the growth in cancer cases.
Executive director Sherl Westlund said research was needed to help prevent a surge in cancer linked to rising rates of diabetes, including type 2 and gestational forms of the disease.
Ahead of the Daffodil Day cancer fundraiser tomorrow, she said cancer rates were increasing because of a range of factors but that diabetes was not commonly associated with cancer.
""Research shows that people with diabetes have a higher risk of being diagnosed with certain cancers including breast, bowel, pancreatic, liver and bladder, and in some cases the risk is up to 70 per cent higher,"" Ms Westlund said.
""It follows then that if we can fund research that can help bring down rates of diabetes and further support lifestyle intervention programs that may prevent some cases of type 2 and gestational diabetes, we should see a reduction in cancer cases.""
She said the group was concerned that many people were unaware of the link. ""Most people don't know diabetes can lead to severe health complications, like cancer, if it's not managed well,"" Ms Westlund said.
""It's also poorly understood that managing diabetes can be extremely difficult, even with the latest advances such as continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps.
""All sorts of things can impact blood sugar levels such as stress, exercise and other medications.""
She said it was a mystery why people with diabetes were more likely to develop some cancers. ""It's suspected high blood sugar or perhaps high insulin levels associated with diabetes... but that's not been confirmed,"" Ms Westlund said.

ELECTION 2016 Diabetes kit to cut bills by $4000
THOUSANDS of kids with Type 1 diabetes will be given pocket-sized continuous glucose monitoring devices that will save lives and spare families $4000 a year.
The new kits will save kids from being woken up in the middle of the night for blood tests to check their glucose levels and can also be combined with insulin pumps to provide more accurate doses.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will announce today that if re-elected his government will devote $54 million to ensure that thousands of families can secure the pocket-sized gadgets for the first time.
In his first major health policy announcement of the campaign, the PM will confirm that all children and young adults under the age of 21 will be eligible for the scheme.
""Our commitment is estimated to benefit as many as 4000 children and young adults, and could save the average family up to $4000 per year off the cost of managing their child's Type 1 diabetes,"" Mr Turnbull said.
""It will help reduce possible visits to emergency departments and missed school days by allowing families and children to better self-manage their diabetes. Most importantly, it will help reduce stress and anxiety for children and their parents, even save lives."" The PM has also averted an election war with pathologists over their threats to leave patients out-of-pocket for blood, urine and pap smear tests in a separate deal that will cap rents at collection centres. The fight with pathologists had sparked warnings that tests could soon cost patients $30 and triggered a major campaign in marginal seats.
Today's announcement on a new deal to help kids with diabetes was hailed by Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation CEO Mike Wilson as a huge win for families who'd campaigned for years for CGM subsidies. Providing 24-hour day glucose monitoring, the kits monitor blood sugar levels through a small device inserted under the skin and left in place for up to six days at a time.
""With Type 1 diabetes you need insulin to stay alive and you can be diagnosed when babies are just a few months old,"" Mr Wilson said.
""Most commonly, the diagnosis is marked by a week to 10 days in hospital with significant fears for the life of the child. You've got to deliver that insulin four or five times a day just to stay alive or risk complication including blindness and heart disease, kidney failure and even amputation.
""CGM gives you real time visibility as what your blood sugars are. ""It means greatly reduced risk of fluctuation that can lead to coma and death... blood sugar levels can go high or low very quickly. ""It will reduce or remove the need for these kids to do 10 to 15 finger pricks a day.""

Pregnancy weight warning for mums
NEW mothers who don't lose baby weight are more at risk of high blood pressure and diabetes the next time they are pregnant, experts warn.
Even a small weight gain increased the odds of problems, which can lead to birth defects and future health issues, a study by Belgium's Leuven University Hospital has found.
Women of healthy weight were most affected.
Almost 8000 women who had their first two children from 2009 to 2011 took part in the study.
Women who were healthy or underweight before their first pregnancy but then retained two BMI units or more in weight - equivalent to about 5kg for a 162cm woman - were four times as likely to have high blood pressure in their second pregnancy.
Those who retained three or more BMI units after pregnancy were twice as likely to have diabetes in their next pregnancy.
Women who started out overweight and retained 5kg were twice as likely to give birth by caesarean section. The study did not say why health risks differed between slim and overweight women.

Drink to dodging diabetes 
GOOD news for tipplers, less so for teetotallers. Booze wards off type-2 diabetes, according to Danish research.
But - and with medical research there are always buts - it also found that women who drink spirits frequently have an increased risk of developing the disease.
The findings, based on data from 70,551 Danish adults, show a link between drinking alcohol three to four times a week and a reduced risk of type-2 diabetes, compared with teetotallers.
Wine drinkers were the least likely to develop diabetes, followed by beer drinkers, but spirits offered no benefit for men and increased women's chance of diabetes, the authors say.
The study, by researchers at the University of Southern Denmark and published in the European diabetes journal Diabetologia, examined the effects of drinking frequency on diabetes risk, and also considered association with specific beverage types.
The study used data from the Danish Health Examination Survey from 2007-08, where adults completed a questionnaire including items on lifestyle and health, and followed it up until 2012.
Lead author Professor Janne Tolstrup said the study excluded people already with diabetes, as well as women who were pregnant or who had recently given birth, due to likely changes in drinking habits.
The data was adjusted for age, sex, level of education, body mass index, smoking status, diet (frequent or infrequent intake of fibre-rich bread or grain, vegetables, salad, fruit and fish), leisure time activity, current or previous hypertension and family history of diabetes.
During the follow-up, 859 men and 887 women developed diabetes. The lowest risk of developing diabetes was found in individuals consuming moderate amounts of alcohol.
Men consuming 14 drinks a week were found to have a 43 per cent lower risk of diabetes relative to no alcohol intake, and women having nine a week had a 58 per cent lower risk compared with women who did not drink at all.
In terms of frequency, the data revealed that drinking alcohol three to four days a week gave the lowest risk of diabetes - a 27 per cent lower risk in men and 32 per cent lower risk in women - when compared to those drinking less than one day a week.
The study found no clear evidence of an association between binge drinking and diabetes risk, which the authors suggest may be due to low statistical power since few participants reported binge drinking.
Prof Tolstrup says: ""Our findings suggest that alcohol drinking frequency is associated with the risk of diabetes and that consumption of alcohol over three to four weekdays is associated with the lowest risks of diabetes."" Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines on alcohol state: ""For healthy men and women, drinking no more than two standard drinks on any day reduces the lifetime risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury.""

Fruitful endeavour
A honeymoon in Greece awakened a love of olives, but it was a chronic disease that led this family to create these groves
BRODIE Higgs was 13 when doctors discovered he had type 1 diabetes, one of Australia's most chronic childhood diseases. His symptoms included a raging thirst and inexplicable weight loss, and treatment entailed insulin injections up to six times a day. Distressed by the diagnosis, parents Steve and Roey began a journey of self-education to discover how best to manage the disease.
The year was 1993 and the Higgses had just sold their cattle farming property and bought more than 400ha near Merriwa in northwest NSW. ""We were starting to get disenfranchised with cattle farming,"" recalls Roey, sitting on the veranda of the couple's Georgian home and gazing out on row upon row of olive trees in the distance. ""It just didn't feel right any more, its use of the land. The way it denudes the country of trees and compacts the soil just didn't feel sustainable. We were looking for something healthier to farm and after Brodie was diagnosed Steve started to do a lot of research.""
That research changed the family's lives. Not long after, Steve - also a corporate financier and one-time chairman of Orlando Wines - became chairman of what was then a Sydney-based parents' support group, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Today Steve is still chairman, and the charity is global and raises $10 million a year for the aim of finding a cure for type 1 diabetes. Steve is also chairman of the Glycemic Index Foundation, a not-for-profit company supported by the University of Sydney and JDRF that aims to make healthy eating choices easier by a system of labelling low-GI foods.
""When Brodie was diagnosed, the words anti-oxidants, oxidative stress and free radicals became part of our vocabulary,"" says Steve, 62. ""Type I diabetes is a premature ageing disease and ageing is caused by oxidative stress on the body. Sadly the cards are stacked against young people today; (our) whole way of life - the environment, preservatives in our food, technology, travel - is putting so much stress on our bodies that we can't cope. There are lots of natural anti-oxidant mechanisms in the body, but not enough to combat the overload of oxidative stress.
""To counter that stress, everything we eat needs to have a huge amount of anti-oxidants, and extra-virgin olive oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants there is. The answer to what Roey and I needed to start farming was staring us in the face.""
Steve and Roey began planting olive trees with Brodie and daughters Ali and Tori working alongside.
""When we understood the health qualities, it just felt right,"" Roey says. ""Our extra-virgin is basically just like a squeezed juice except it is freshly squeezed olives and absolutely nothing else. When we started out we still rather naively had the notion that olive groves were soulful and romantic, after our honeymoon in Greece."" She laughs and adds ruefully that years of hard yakka have put paid to that sentimental notion.
""We originally planted 50 trees in the corner of the house paddock to see if they would grow, and we didn't water them much or nurture them and they did quite well. So every school holidays after that we would drag the kids up the hills and mark out lines and put the trees in.""
During the next 15 years the Higgses planted 60,000 trees. ""It was hard work at the time but it proved to be the right decision because having that many trees means we could have our own harvester and press and be self-sufficient,"" Roey says.
Today the Higgses have one of the largest family-owned groves in Australia, with their label ROSTO - Roey and Steve's Olive Oil - producing about 150,000 litres of EVOO a year. Ali, 39, Tori, 37, and Brodie, 33, are all still directly involved in the business. Singapore-based Ali does the accounts, Sydneysider Tori the marketing and Brodie, a filmmaker, looks after the online, graphic and visual elements. Steve and Roey tend the trees, oversee the annual harvest and undertake the all-night pressing sessions. Roey is master blender and mixes the nine olive varieties to get the required flavour for the brand's two blends, ROSTO Extra Oomph, and ROSTO Mellow. The family also has started exporting to China.
And Brodie's disease is under control and free of the complications he suffered in the early days.
""Complications of this type are common but the use of diet and foods rich in anti-oxidants can help prevent them,"" Roey says. ""The fact the oil we produce is full of anti-oxidants and is a really healthy product means a lot to us, especially in view of Brodie's diagnosis all those years ago. It would make me sick to think I was selling an unhealthy product to people."" ROSTO will be at FEVOO Harvest 2013 in Sydney on July 10, with special guest Stephanie Alexander.

Promise of diet drink false, says study
A DIET soft drink a day could be making you fat, more likely to get diabetes and at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
Artificial sweeteners in the drinks are meant to provide the taste without the calories.
But a major review of scientific studies suggests they may interfere with the body's normal energy regulation.
Researcher Susan Swithers, of Purdue University in the US, says sweet tastes normally trigger a psychological response that signals the arrival of nutrients in the stomach.
However, research shows that when no such energy burst follows, over time this appears to weaken the body's response to a sweet taste.
""By weakening the validity of sweet taste as a signal... consumption of artificial sweeteners could impair energy and body weight regulation,"" she says in a paper published in Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism.
The research looked at 15 large health studies from around the world that included data on artificial sweetener consumption over the past 40 years.
The clear conclusion was that there was ""little support for artificially sweetened beverages in promoting weight loss or preventing negative health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome (increased blood pressure, high fasting blood glucose, large waist circumference, high cholesterol), and cardiovascular events"".
Some studies suggested people who regularly consumed artificially sweetened beverages were at greater risk.
The San Antonio Heart study of 1250 men and women found risk of weight gain and obesity were greater in those consuming artificially sweetened beverages.
A European study of health professionals of around 40,000 men found the risk of type 2 diabetes doubled for the heaviest drinkers of artificially sweetened beverages.
The nurses health study, which included more than 88,000 women, found the risk for type 2 diabetes was increased by consuming only one artificially sweetened beverage a day.

Big challenge for brave little girl

Type 1 diabetes happens when the pancreas does not produce insulin because the cells that make insulin have been destroyed by the immune system.
There is no cure yet.
Type 2 diabetes is caused by eating poorly and a lack of exercise.
More than 25,400 Tasmanians are living with diabetes.
Warning signs for Type 1 may include thirst, frequent urination, lethargy, blurred vision, sudden weight loss, infections or wounds that don't heal, constant hunger, and mood swings.

Diabetes study wants exercise with balance
WA researchers are recruiting young people with diabetes into a study to see how blood sugar levels affect how they exercise.
Doctors often encourage people with type 1 diabetes to exercise, but it can cause their blood sugar levels to go too high or low, making some wary about working out.
Diabetes Research WA has given researchers $80,000 to look at the impact of blood sugar levels on exercise performance.
DRWA executive director Sherl Westlund said rates of type 1 diabetes were rising in Australia so more research was needed to help people cope with the condition.
Project supervisor Karen Rothacker, an endocrinology and diabetes researcher at Princess Margaret Hospital, said type 1 diabetes was an auto-immune disease and not caused by an unhealthy lifestyle.
But regular physical activity reduced a patient's risk of cardiovascular disease and stress, and helped control their weight.
""However, because exercise can cause blood sugar levels to go too high or too low, it can create issues in managing type 1 diabetes, which may deter those with it from engaging in physical activity,"" Dr Rothacker said.
""We suspect that exercising with high blood glucose levels negatively impacts exercise performance and we also want to look at the differences when exercising with standard or low insulin rates.""
Dr Rothacker said she hoped the research would give doctors and diabetes educators a clear picture of how blood sugars and insulin affected exercise performance, and this could help people with type 1 diabetes to perform at their best.
The project is recruiting 22 people with type 1 diabetes aged 14 to 26 who have had diabetes for more than a year.
They include Noah Fleming, 16, of Churchlands, who was diagnosed at age 14.
Diabetes Research WA, which is based at Royal Perth Hospital, was established in 1976 to stimulate research into diabetes in WA.
It has distributed more than $5 million for this work.

Diabetics face higher bills, health risks under new cuts: doctors
Diabetics could be out of pocket hundreds of dollars each year for their treatment if cuts to pathology go ahead, which could ultimately raise the risk of health complications including kidney disease, doctors warn. Health Minister Sussan Ley flagged plans to cut and limit bulk-billing incentive payments for pathology and diagnostic imaging services last month, saving the government $650million over four years. Dr Nick Musgrave, president of Pathology Australia, said that without the payment, most pathology services would no longer be bulk-billed. Major pathology providers have already indicated they will pass losses from the cuts on to patients. About 1.7 million Australians with diabetes, he said, could have to pay more than $400 upfront for a year of standard blood and urine tests to monitor their kidneys and risk of heart disease. Higher costs could deter some patients from doing the tests ""making management of their diabetes more difficult for their doctors, and will result in an increase in complications of diabetes including kidney disease and blindness"", Dr Musgrave said. This follows reports that the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia said pap smears could cost women at least $30 upfront if the cuts go ahead. Ms Ley's spokesman last week said that the government was not changing the Medicare rebate for pap smears but removing an ""inefficient payment"" to pathology firms. Patients would be ""rightly suspicious"" of providers claiming they will raise costs to make up losses, he said. Dr Musgrave said that even with the rebate, patients with diabetes will still be left about $270 out of pocket a year, as the Medicare rebate for pathology services had been frozen for the past 20 years: ""It doesn't matter how the government would like to construct the funding of the tests, [the bulk-billing incentive is] part of the overall funding for them."" Diabetes educator and nurse Cheryl Steele said that Type 2 diabetes patients over 50 years, including pensioners, were most likely to forgo pathology tests, risking kidney and cardiovascular diseases. ""We have patients who will take medication for blood pressure this month and cholesterol next month because they can't afford it all,"" Ms Steele said. ""Anything that puts extra burden on them to maintain good health will ultimately end up costing more hospital beds."" Dr Musgrave said that higher pathology fees could also deter patients from getting tested for conditions that do not display obvious initial symptoms, including cervical, bowel and prostate cancers. Ms Ley's spokesman said the Medicare rebate for pathology tests remained the same, and the tests were still covered by the Medicare Safety Net. He called pathologists' warnings ""opportunistic"", saying it ""shows this debate is really about protecting profits, not patients"".

Caffeine in drinks link to diabetes
CAFFEINATED energy drinks cause a 25 per cent spike in teenagers blood glucose and insulin levels even when they contain no sugar, alarming new research shows.
A study to be presented to a world diabetes conference in Vancouver, Canada, has found the caffeine alone in the drinks could predispose people to diabetes and heart disease.
About 30 per cent of teenagers and half of all young adults consume the drinks, which have been associated with a handful of deaths worldwide and over 300 health events, including 128 hospitalisations in Australia.
Consumption of the drinks in Australia surged fivefold in the decade to 2010 and some experts are calling for them to be banned from sale to those aged under 18.
The chief concern is the amount of caffeine they contain and the fact they are aggressively marketed to children.
Energy drinks typically contain about 80mg of caffeine.
Deakin University research has found, on average, children first use these drinks at the age of 10 in Australia. Children and adolescents are much more likely to ingest higher amounts of caffeine per kilogram of body mass when they consume these drinks.

WHEN 78-year-old Kathleen Wordsworth tells people she's going on a charity bike ride around China next month they often think she's joking.

Diabetes huge health issue for Tasmanians
Politicians are on their bikes to fight it, write Guy Barnett and Caroline Wells
Tasmanian politicians and community members celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Tasmanian Pollie Pedal last weekend with a ride through the Coal River Valley, Huon Valley and Derwent Valley.
The annual event raises money for Diabetes Tasmania and covers about 300km during the three-day event.
Since the event started a decade ago more than 3000km has been covered and $430,000 raised to support Tasmanians with diabetes, those at risk and also to promote a healthy lifestyle to Tasmanians.
The bike ride is the flagship fundraising event of the year for the charity and helps Diabetes Tasmania to continue its work.
We engage schools and communities throughout Tasmania on this cycling journey. The community support has been fantastic with some people just stopping us in the street offering support.
Tasmania's hilly geography can be hard work, but it's for a great cause. Type 2 diabetes is the fastest growing chronic disease in Australia. Complications associated with the disease are devastating.
Diabetes is the leading cause of preventable blindness, lower limb amputation and the single most common cause of kidney failure.
Heart attacks and strokes are four times more likely in people with diabetes. There are 27,000 Tasmanians diagnosed with diabetes and a further 10,000 undiagnosed with type-2 diabetes, which is sometimes referred to as a lifestyle disease, although age and family history are also risk factors.
This is a ticking health bomb with another 45,000 Tasmanians having pre-diabetes, meaning they are at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes.
A further 3000 Tasmanians have type-1 diabetes which requires multiple daily insulin injections or insulin delivered constantly through an insulin pump.
Diabetes Tasmania has been able to provide support and care for children with diabetes, including four camps per year providing hands-on advice and education as well as supporting the families of these children in need.
Diabetes Tasmania has established TOYS (Type One Youth Support) programs which includes the promotion of diabetes friendly schools and health promotion through events such as the School Triathlon Challenge which encourages participation at every level.
The ""Adopt a Kid in your Life"" program assists grandparents and other carers to support children with type 1 diabetes that may require up to 5 injections per day and the careful management of food intake and exercise.
The Diabetes Tasmania Healthy Shopping Tours and various education and awareness initiatives promoting healthy living also benefit from the funds raised.
The 21st-century has brought with it access to energy dense processed food that is high in salt, fat and sugar.
It is hard for all of us, especially for children swamped with new technologies and a more modern sedentary lifestyles, including non-active transport and urban living.
All these are pressures are fighting against healthy living. The Tasmanian Pollie Pedal is designed to make a difference and it has, since it started 10 years ago.
We have helped thousands of Tasmanians and we want to continue it for many years into the future.

Diabetes figures scary for insurers
Hospitals faced a surge of type two diabetes patients over the past three years, alarming health insurance companies about their growing medical bills.
Medibank chief medical officer Linda Swan said the figures sent a clear signal to the health fund that it needed to staunch the spiralling cost of type two diabetes.
""We've been hearing about the epidemic of diabetes for years, but it's not until you see the stark reality that you see this is growing at an extraordinary rate and clearly we're not doing enough,"" Dr Swan said.
Dr Swan said most type two diabetes hospital presentations were avoidable, but the quandary was how to prevent them in the most efficient way.
""We're seeing in Australia an ageing population and an increasing number of people with chronic disease and obviously that's driving the cost of health care, but what we're hearing from our members is they don't want to pay more for health care.
""That's the challenge our industry faces,"" she said.
Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said the disease threatened to overwhelm the viability of the national health system, with 4400 amputations performed in hospitals each year and 10,000 admissions due to ulcers and foot sores, many of them preventable.
""Diabetes is a very significant driver of hospitalisations when you look at all of the complications,"" Professor Johnson said.
""I think health insurers are very worried because they're substantial funders of the hospitals.
""People with diabetes are potentially big costs to them and they're starting to wake up to that and do programs that keep people healthy.""

Protein may cure diabetes 
SCIENTISTS have discovered a treatment for type 2 diabetes which could reverse the fast-growing disease.
The researchers found that a protein which is already naturally produced in the body cured the disease in mice and they are confident that it could be easily replicated in humans.
The protein, called FGF1, already plays a natural role in human cell growth and tissue repair - but it never usually enters the blood stream.
Diabetes experts found that when the protein was injected into a muscle and interacted with the blood, it dramatically reduced blood sugar levels.
Crucially, the protein also seems to reverse the root cause of type 2 diabetes - making the metabolic system react to insulin when it had been failing to do so. In obese mice with a rodent version of type 2 diabetes, just one injection of the protein FGF1 restored blood sugar levels to a healthy range for more than two days. Continued treatment with the protein reversed insulin insensitivity.

Weekend lie-in dangerous to health
HAVING a lie-in on the weekend could raise the risk of diabetes and heart disease, researchers have warned.
Even moderate changes to the time you get up, such as waking early for work in the week or sleeping in on a day off, could lead to ill health.
Researchers have long recognised that shift workers can suffer increased ill health because of the continual disruption to the circadian system, or natural body clock. They are more likely to develop heart disease and type 2 diabetes than those with regular day shifts.
In the latest study, middle-aged individuals who got up at odd hours were found to have raised levels of fat in their blood and less of a compound that lowers blood sugar levels.
The research, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, is the first to link so-called ""social jetlag"" in non-shift workers with metabolic illnesses, such as diabetes. Researchers said bosses need to consider the impact of work on sleep and health. Participants who had a greater misalignment between their sleep schedules on free and work days tended to have poorer cholesterol profiles, higher fasting insulin levels, larger waist circumference, higher body-mass index and were more resistant to insulin.

MOTHER'S LITTLE LIFESAVER
A SEVEN-year-old girl is being hailed as a hero for saving her mother's life when the woman almost died after an encounter with a chocolate cake.
Sara Beale, a type 1 diabetic, collapsed after she gave herself too much insulin so she could have a slice of her daughter's birthday cake. The 34-year-old's blood glucose levels dropped dangerously low - a condition called hypoglycaemia - because the cake was not as sugary as she expected.
Her daughter, Alex, tried to use her mobile phone to call triple 0, but couldn't unlock it.
Knowing she had to act quickly to save her mum's life, Alex got their two dogs and three-year-old sister to guard Sara while she ran next door to get help.
Neighbour Lynne Griffin grabbed her phone, called triple 0 and rushed to her aid.
When she found Mrs Beale, she noticed that Alex had even tried to give her some lollies to increase her blood glucose levels.
Ambulance Victoria Wonthaggi team manager Danny Slattery said paramedics were astounded by Alex's calm demeanour and quick thinking.

Alex, who now says she wants to be a paramedic, received an Ambulance Victoria bravery award yesterday.

Diet no diabetes cure
DEVOTEES of the Paleo diet shouldn't bank on it beating type 2 diabetes now that a leading health researcher is warning there is no evidence that eating like our ancestors helps the medical condition.
Obesity is a major risk factor in developing type 2 diabetes, and while the cave-man diet involves avoiding processed food and refined sugars, it also involves cutting out important sources of fibre and calcium, such as wholegrains and diary.
Advocates of the diet, including chef Pete Evans, believe it is an effective way to reduce weight and gain glycaemic control, while some people even claim it can get them off their diabetes medication.
Associate Professor Sof Andrikopoulos, a researcher at the University of Melbourne Department of Medicine, at Austin Hospital, reviewed all the scientific, peer-reviewed evidence on the diet. Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia, he said: ""The evidence is that there is no evidence that this (Paleo) diet is good for diabetics.""

WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
Red or white - benefits of drinking wine
Which is better for you: white wine or red? - I. S. (Rostrevor) Drinking red wine with dinner may improve the heart health of people with Type 2 diabetes, according to an Israeli study (The Advertiser 14/10/15). Introducing moderate wine consumption to teetotal patients led to healthier blood fat, including more 'good' cholesterol compared with 'bad', the trial showed.
Some individuals whose bodies broke down alcohol slowly also achieved better blood sugar control. White wine did not show the same benefits.
People with diabetes should discuss this with their doctor. Other studies have shown that red wine is high in antioxidants, which can help prevent certain cancers, help maintain a healthy heart and improve mental health too.
Red wine has been proven to contain levels of a natural compound called resveratrol, which is beneficial to improving the spinal bone density of those suffering from metabolic syndrome, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.
Calories need to be considered too. With rose, the sweeter the wine, the higher the calories; a large glass is around 200 calories.
With champagne, the drier styles are lower in calories (around 90), but sweeter varieties contain up to 160. Dessert wine has a higher content.
The Department of Health reminds the public that factors such as gender, age, mental health, drug use, and existing medical conditions can change how alcohol affects one.
Guidelines recommend that for healthy men and women, drinking no more than two standard drinks on any day reduces your risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury over a lifetime.

A cup of cheer for diabetics
WOMEN with diabetes who drink a cup of tea or coffee every day can expect to live a longer life.
Researchers who tracked more than 3000 diabetes sufferers over 11 years found that regular caffeine consumption was linked to women living longer compared to those who drank none at all.
But, unfortunately for men, it seemed the coffee and tea had no effect on males with the condition. The study, presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes' annual meeting in Lisbon, found women who consumed the caffeine equivalent of one cup of coffee a day were 51 per cent less likely to die during the 11 years, increasing to 57 per cent for two cups and 66 per cent for more. The University of Porto team found coffee drinking was linked to a lower risk of death from any cause, particularly cardiovascular disease, while women who drank tea appeared to be less likely to die from cancer. The researchers did not look at why the drinks had such an impact, but previous studies suggest antioxidant compounds in tea and coffee - rather than the caffeine itself - is probably responsible for the health benefits.

Type 2 diabetes kills more young sufferers
YOUNG people with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to die as those with type 1 diabetes, a study shows.
The research also points to cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death in young people from the type 2 ""lifestyle disease"", usually associated with older people and considered less serious than its insulin-dependent type 1 counterpart.
The diabetes centre at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital examined the records of patients diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 30 in the past 20 years.
""Despite getting the same treatment, the people with type 2 had double the risk of dying within that time,"" Dr Ted Wu said.
""It just shows the insidious nature of type 2 diabetes. Just because you're on tablets and not insulin (injections) doesn't mean it's not serious.""

Push to treat obesity like a disease
A peak diabetes group wants obesity to be treated like a disease rather than trying to shame people with simplistic messages about losing weight and getting fit.
Diabetes Research WA said that while lifestyle factors could help, obesity and type 2 diabetes were complex diseases, with genetic and other influences.
Ahead of National Diabetes Week starting on July 10, executive director Sherl Westlund said obesity was a key factor for type 2 diabetes, and rates of both were rising.
""It's creating huge health issues as well as putting a lot of pressure on our health budgets, but there's still a widespread belief that the solution is as simple as telling people to lose weight and get fit,"" she said.
""While that sort of belief exists, there's a very real danger not enough will be done to ensure we help people deal with it.""
She said that while a healthy life-style was important, research showed that about one in three people were unlikely to be able to avoid developing type 2 diabetes even if they made significant changes.
Ms Westlund said changing the perception of obesity would pave the way for more medical interventions to help those affected by it.
""We're very hopeful that when obesity is seen as a medical condition the focus can shift away from blaming and shaming people who are impacted by it, to serious attention being put on the solutions,"" she said.
""Even when considering the 68 per cent of cases which could be prevented by maintaining a healthy body weight and exercising, the challenges many people face in doing this are undeniably massive.""
She said longer working hours, the affordability and availability of fresh food, fast food and a lack of structured nutrition education were contributing to overeating.
There was an urgent need to look at measures such as a sugar tax, more flexible working hours, weatherproof spaces to exercise, and a requirement for food outlets to offer downsized options.

On top of that is the sweet stuff - and the alcohol: one whole pudding, a dozen mince pies and almost a litre of custard, 36 beers and five bottle of wine.

Christmas lunch, Boxing Day leftovers, two workplace parties and two dates with mates is all it takes to potentially consume 1kg of fat, which can have long-lasting health effects.

The $70 million announcement on new, revolutionary medicines to be listed on the PBS, will also include breakthrough treatments for cervical cancer and other life-changing illnesses. But the new diabetes treatments are expected to be cost-neutral because they provide alternatives to existing treatments.

""Our announcement will help save the lives of over 200 Australian women who aren't responding to conventional treatments for their cervical cancer and therapy was previously out of reach at $55,000 per course of treatment,"" Ms Ley said. ""They will now pay just $6.20 per script if they're a concessional patient or $38.10 if they're a general patient.""

Diet hope is sweet for women and babies
DIET alone is able to remove one of the most common and dangerous risks from many women with gestational diabetes - having big babies.
Women who develop diabetes during pregnancy are up to 50 per cent more likely to have a large baby.
This increases the risk of labour injuries to mum and bub, raises the chance of a caesarean delivery and of babies needing special care treatment after birth.
The findings by Melbourne's Royal Women's Hospital, published today in Journal of Pregnancy, will mean that women with gestational diabetes who can meet blood sugar targets through diet changes will no longer be classified as a high-risk pregnancy.
Lead researcher Dr Fatima Vally hoped this may lead to these women needing fewer scans and specialist appointments in the final trimester, and avoid induction of labour.
""Up until now, all women in pregnancy with diabetes are treated as a high-risk pregnancy, whether they are using diet, insulin, or other medications to control their diabetes,"" she said.
""Diet has always been the first port of call for managing diabetes in pregnancy. However no study has looked at whether diet can reduce the known risk of having bigger babies."" The researchers looked retrospectively at 202 women who were controlling their gestational diabetes with diet, cross matching them by age and BMI to pregnant women without diabetes.
Babies born to women with diet controlled diabetes were surprisingly slightly smaller than average.
The low-sugar and low-GI diet involves a more even spacing of meals eaten over the day to help keep blood sugars better controlled.
Marlouka Von Eisenhart-Rothe, whose first child is due next week, has been able to remove herself from the high-risk group through a range of diet changes following her diabetes diagnosis. ""I had to stop drinking juice and... make sure I spread all my food over the day,"" she said. ""My baby is growing at normal size and weight.

Diabetes: serious and widespread yet so often misunderstood
In National Diabetes Week, it's time to clear up some common misconceptions, says Caroline Wells.
DIABETES is something that we have all heard about, but the misconceptions and misunderstandings around the disease are immense.
So many times I have heard people say, ""I only have a touch of sugar"", ""I don't have the serious type"" or, both inappropriately and sadly, ""it's your fault you have diabetes"".
Qualitative research conducted early this year by Diabetes Australia demonstrated the need to enhance awareness of diabetes, and to develop strategies to address the misconceptions of an individual's susceptibility to diabetes. Participants in this study were shocked to learn that 280 Australians develop diabetes every day, and that diabetes is set to become our leading burden of disease in the next five years.
One point I would like to clear up is that there is no such thing as ""mild"" diabetes. Diabetes is a progressive, unrelenting and challenging disease with serious complications, which has immense human, societal and financial burdens.
In Tasmania alone, we have more than 27,000 people diagnosed with diabetes, 10,000 people living with the disease but undiagnosed, and 45,000 at high risk - which equates to about 16 per cent of the population.
There are also many misconceptions about type 1 diabetes. The truth is that there is no association between lifestyle factors and the development of type 1 diabetes in an individual. Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease which cannot be prevented.
Unfortunately many Tasmanians don't consider diabetes to be a serious disease. One reason for this misconception may be that type 2 diabetes can often go unnoticed and consequently undiagnosed, and that for some the first sign can be a complication of the disease, such as a heart attack, vision problems or a foot ulcer.
There is also the misconception that only older or obese people will develop type 2 diabetes. Yes, obesity and weight gain are significant risk factors, but in fact you can still develop type 2 diabetes and be a healthy weight and physically active. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Many people are unaware that there are many risk factors associated with developing the disease that we simply cannot change. Sadly we cannot do anything about our age, and as we age our risk of developing diabetes increases.
Similarly, we cannot change our family history of diabetes or our ethnicity, both being risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. We can, however, do something about those modifiable risk factors, including our diet, how much physical activity we do, weight gain and whether or not we are a smoker. These are all factors within our control.
I would urge all Tasmanians to be more tolerant and to remember that while obesity is certainly significant in the escalating number of people developing type 2 diabetes, it is sometimes not as easy as just getting off the couch and eating more vegetables. Sometimes an individual may have no safe areas to walk in, or have limited access to affordable and healthy food, compounded by the impact of low literacy skills.
As well as the steps we can all individually take, we must look at what we can do collectively, and how all Tasmanians can be supported to live healthier lifestyles.
As a community let us all learn more about diabetes. The more we understand, the more tolerant and supportive we will be. Wouldn't it be a wonderful place to live, where the apportion of blame was a thing of the past and where we all understand the seriousness of diabetes and its impact on people and their families.

Hollie will take on the eighth annual Schools Triathlon Challenge on December 1 and 2 to help raise money and awareness for Diabetes Tasmania, as classmate Holly fights her own, personal battle with the disease.
Holly, who was diagnosed this year, is among 3000 Tasmanian children living with type 1 diabetes.
The Blackmans Bay primary student, 11, said she was shocked to discover she had the disease.
Now her classmate has raised more than $1000, with challenge organiser Tim Smith hoping to raise $6000 in total.
This is the first year the challenge has incorporated fundraising. ""We're currently sitting near $5000 and if we can crack the six we can send four families to diabetes camp,"" Mr Smith said.
""Holly's story shows that the challenge is reaching beyond the event, to the kids, their families and the community."" The triathlon includes a bike ride, swim and run and tests students from years 3 to 12 on courses ranging from 3km to 13km.
The event has broken its own record this year, with more than 5000 individual entries across 140 schools this year.
It runs in Devonport on November 23 and 24 at Devonport Bluff and in Hobart on December 1 and 2 at Bellerive Beach.

Scuba diving in for diabetes
Bec Johnson is at her happiest exploring the ocean's depths.
But until recently, the type 1 diabetic was held back from pursuing her passion in her home country.
Ms Johnson, 33, could not get medical clearance to scuba dive in Australia and had to travel to Thailand to get the training she needed. The Australian Diabetes Society this month changed its regulations to allow people with the condition to dive.
Ms Johnson, chief executive of the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre, was instrumental in the change.
""When I found out I couldn't do my dive training in Australia, it was devastating,"" she said.
""I got medical clearance overseas - I just had to prove I could control my blood sugar levels and that I understood how exercise impacted my body.
""People with type 1 diabetes have been allowed to dive in the UK, US and Europe for more than 10 years.""
Ms Johnson spoke at last year's South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society conference in Micronesia, where she dived with doctors each day. Armed with a deeper insight into how diving affected diabetics, she helped convince the ADS to change its position on the issue.
ADS chief executive Sof Andrikopoulos said the society recognised ""that with appropriate preparation, experience and adherence to the new recommendations, people with diabetes are able to dive safely"".

Two diabetes diagnoses challenge young couple
Kathryn Jeffress' eyes filled with tears as she recalled the moment she was told her two-year-old son Ethan - who had just been diagnosed with type one diabetes - may not survive the night. He'd been constantly eating, drinking, and soaking his nappies, while dramatically losing weight. The toddler became critically ill and spent a week in hospital at risk of liver failure and other complications. He had a four-year-old sister Amy and a newborn sister Mia at the time. ""It was horrific, dealing with that and after giving birth, I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone,"" Mrs Jeffress said. Around a year later, Mia was also diagnosed with type one diabetes. ""My knees just buckled under me and I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach, because I knew in that moment, that having two [with diabetes] was a whole new level."" ""I was always praying to god to please spare my girls and now I'm dreading that Amy will get it and we'll hit the trifecta."" Type one diabetes is a life-long chronic condition that affects over 120,000 people in Australia, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation claims. More than 350 families in the ACT and surrounding areas are affected. There is no known cure. Type one is considered the more severe form of diabetes because the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach, are unable to make insulin. Without insulin, the body can't turn glucose into energy and the body starves itself. On Saturday, the Florey family will join the JDRF Twilight One Walk in Reid, for which they have raised more than $11,000 in the past three years. Mrs Jeffress is confident that if a cure is found, JDRF will be behind the miracle. Meanwhile, she and Mr Jeffress spend their days measuring everything Ethan and Mia eat and drink, counting insulin doses, and changing the cannulas that are permanently inserted into their bodies. They spend $200 a week on two glucose monitors. ""I fear every day that I'll go to pick Ethan up from school and he won't be there,"" Mrs Jeffress said. ""More importantly, I fear: Will they wake up in the morning?"" This anxiety is worsened by two factors: When people assume all diabetes is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle (and ask if she gave them too much sugar as babies) and when her children cry out in pain from having their cannulas changed. But her little angels make the most of their situations. While Ethan cannot pursue some occupations, he's already decided on becoming a doctor so he can follow in his own doctor's footsteps of helping others.

Dietary factions are hurting the fight against obesity
Australia is in the grip of the twin crises of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and despite all efforts, it continues to worsen. A staggering 280 Australians develop diabetes every day. That's one person every five minutes with a total annual cost impact of diabetes in Australia estimated to be $14.6 billion.
There are so many dietary factions out there. Do you listen to the ""low calorie"" camp, the ""low fat"" camp, the ""high protein"" camp, the ""low carb"" camp, or the ""low GI"" camp? They all say they've got the answer for what ails you.
Efforts on the part of individuals to lose weight through caloric restriction or increased exercise are rarely successful; and if they are, the weight loss doesn't last long. It's assumed that people who are obese are ""non-compliant"" or ""weak-willed"". Rather, they are fighting a losing battle. Following current dietary advice is counter-intuitive to achieving a healthy weight.
The reason is the myth of energy balance. If you believe this, then you believe that obesity is a physics problem; too much energy in, too little energy out. Energy balance assumes that all calories are equal, no matter where they come from. Rather, obesity is about energy deposition into fat tissue. Obesity is a biochemistry problem, and where those nutrients came from determine where they go in the body. It's called nutritional biochemistry and it shows that all calories are not created equal.
Rather, it's the insulin response that determines whether any given calories will deposit into fat tissue or not. Insulin has two roles in the body. The first is to store energy in fat cells, driving weight gain. The second is to block the signal of the hormone leptin in the brain.
Leptin is a hormone made in fat cells. When leptin works as it is supposed to, it tells the brain that we do not need to eat so much and then we can burn energy at a normal rate.
High insulin levels can block the action of leptin in the brain and trick our body into thinking it's starving. How do you feel when you're starved? Hungry and slothy. Obesity is brain starvation. This explains how elevated insulin levels block leptin signalling, and therefore increase food intake, decrease activity, and promote weight gain.
Put simply, insulin drives all of the behaviours seen in obesity. The biochemistry comes first.
In Australia, almost two in three people are overweight or obese and 6 per cent have diabetes; this number has tripled in just 15 years. I believe one of the main culprits is sugar in the Australian diet.
Most people think sugar is just another form of over-consumed kilojoules. Our research says otherwise. We have shown that sugar is toxic (unrelated to its calories or its effects on weight gain) and directly responsible for a host of chronic diseases.
Dietary sugar (sucrose) is composed of two molecules, glucose and fructose. While the glucose raises insulin and promotes weight gain, it's the fructose that leads to chronic diseases like diabetes. Fructose is metabolised in the liver in the same way as alcohol, so it should not be surprising that children now get the diseases of alcohol (type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease) without consuming alcohol.
Our research shows that total caloric availability is unrelated to diabetes prevalence worldwide. For every extra 150 calories per person per day available in any country, diabetes prevalence rose by only 0.1 per cent. But if those 150 calories per day happened to be a can of soda, diabetes prevalence rose 11-fold, by 1.1 per cent. In fact, we have proof-positive data that sugar causes four chronic diseases: type 2 diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, and tooth decay.
Sugar also stimulates the reward centre of the brain similar to what nicotine, heroin, or alcohol does, driving continued consumption.
Studies show that sugar is slowly killing people around the world, anywhere the Western diet has replaced indigenous diets. Sugar is ubiquitous, appearing in virtually every processed food, and so it's not easy to reduce your consumption of sugar. The World Health Organisation recommends limiting our intake of free sugars to no more than 10 per cent of total daily energy intake to reduce the risk of metabolic disease, such as diabetes.
In Australia the guidelines say just 5 per cent of the daily diet, or about six teaspoons, can come from added sugars, but Australians actually eat double that - more like 14 teaspoons.
The easiest way to dramatically cut down on sugar and fructose consumption is to switch to a diet of ""real"" i.e. whole, unprocessed foods. But this is not what the food industry is selling.
And all those dietary factions? There are two things that every successful diet out there shares. They're all ""low-sugar, high-fibre"". Because they're all REAL food. Processed food is the enemy.
Reducing sugar and processed food and turning back the obesity and diabetes epidemics won't be easy but it's up to every one of us.

Pedo Ferguson stopped taking meds in final bid to 'show' police
PAEDOPHILE Dennis Ferguson chose to end his own life by suddenly stopping his diabetes medication, telling supporters he blamed the police for making his life a living hell.
""This will show them,"" Australia's most notorious sex offender said in the days before he died at his Surry Hills flat, a Department of Housing property on Poplar Avenue, just a stone's throw from Sydney Grammar and other schools and childcare centres.
His body laid undiscovered for several days before being found last Sunday.
Ferguson's biggest advocate, the Justice Action campaigner Brett Collins, says that police continuously ""undermined"" the 64-year-old's efforts to redeem himself and tipped off the media about his whereabouts at least twice.
""He said to people (when he stopped taking insulin), 'That will show them,""' Mr Collins said. ""What we're saying is Dennis Ferguson was killed by the police.""

Vegetarian diet twice as effective for weight loss
Low-calorie diets are notoriously difficult to maintain in the long-term. But they may be unnecessary. Switching to a vegetarian diet can be twice as effective for weight-loss as counting calories, according to new research.
For the study, published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, researchers from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine followed 74 participants with type 2 diabetes for six months. Half the group were assigned a vegetarian diet (60 per cent of energy from carbohydrates, 15 per cent protein, and 25 per cent fat) consisting of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts, with one portion of low-fat yoghurt a day.
The other half were assigned a conventional low-calorie, anti-diabetes diet comprising of 50 per cent of energy from carbohydrates, 20 per cent protein, less than 30 per cent fat. After six months, the vegetarian group had lost an average of 6.2 kilograms compared with 3.2 kilograms in the conventional group.
The researchers also used magnetic resonance imaging to analyse the effect of the two diets on adipose fat in participants' thighs. While both diets reduced subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin), only the vegetarian diet caused reductions in subfascial fat (on the surface of muscles) and saw a greater reduction in intramuscular fat (inside the muscles).
Excess subfascial and intramuscular fat is associated with insulin resistance and lowered glucose metabolism. ""Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss,"" said lead author, Dr Hana Kahleova. ""However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism. This finding is important for people who are trying to lose weight, including those suffering from metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes. But it is also relevant to anyone who takes their weight management seriously and wants to stay lean and healthy.""
Dr Joanna McMillan believes the vegetarian diet was more effective because it tends to include more fibre from plant foods. ""This helps to fill you up but also means the gut bugs have to help with nutrient retrieval,"" Dr McMillan explained. ""Potentially our gut bugs help us to stay lean or get fat depending on our individual microbiomes and usual diet.""
Our genes may come into play as well, as another new study, published in the journal Nature: Ecology and Evolution, found that the introduction of farming 10,000 years ago led to an increase in plant-based diets.
This dietary shift from the animal-based diet of hunter-gatherers resulted in genetic adaptations that helped vegetarians and their offspring to better metabolise plant-foods. The plant-based gene variants regulate cholesterol levels and may provide protection against many inflammatory diseases, the researchers from Cornell University said.
""Although modern paleo advocates emphasise meat, in fact most hunter gatherer communities ate loads of plant food as well - so the balance of foods is clearly key,"" McMillan said. ""Although our genes can't change quickly, epigenetics allows us to adapt more quickly and the microbiome can adapt within a day. This is probably how humans have thrived on many different diets all over the world.""

DRUG BREAKTHROUGH FOR TYPE-2 DIABETES 
DIABETES will no longer be a death sentence for many sufferers with a drug commonly prescribed to lower sugar levels found to significantly reduce heart problems - the biggest killer of diabetics.
Australian doctors have now been given the green light to prescribe the drug Jardiance to Type-2 diabetics with cardiovascular issues with the change being hailed as a significant advance in the battle against the scourge of diabetes. About 80 per cent of diabetics die from cardiovascular complications such as heart attack.
Diabetes medications lower blood sugar, which can prevent complications like blindness and kidney damage, but do nothing for heart health.
The Therapeutic Goods Association has now listed Jardiance for use to reduce cardiovascular deaths in diabetics - the first drug to ever offer that benefit.
Sydney cardiologist Professor Andrew Sindone hailed the drug as a ""big advance"" and said a third of his patients had diabetes. ""It's a big epidemic and this change will have a big impact on those people's health,"" he said, adding the drug would revolutionise management of diabetics.

Low-fat yoghurt may cut diabetes risk
Eating low-fat yoghurt can reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by almost a third, a new study has shown.
The Cambridge University study, published in the journal Diabetologia, analysed seven-day food diaries kept by 4000 British men and women aged 45 to 74 years, including 753 who developed type-2 diabetes over the following 11 years.
Researchers divided participants into low, medium and high consumers of dairy and also analysed the type of dairy products they were consuming.
They found that people who consumed the highest amount of low-fat yoghurt had a 28 per cent reduced risk of developing diabetes compared to people who did not consume low-fat yoghurt.
The group consumed an average of 4.5 125-gram pots of low-fat yoghurt a week. The researchers classified products containing less than 3.9 per cent fat as low fat.
High consumption of other low-fat fermented dairy products, including cottage cheese and fromage frais, was also associated with a reduced risk of developing type-2 diabetes. The researchers did not find any association between total or high-fat dairy consumption, or consumption of any kind of milk, and the risk of developing type-2 diabetes.
An endocrinologist at Melbourne's Austin Hospital, Richard O'Brien, said the study did not prove that eating low-fat fermented dairy products caused the reduced diabetes risk, although there was a potential scientific basis for the link.
He said it was possible that chemicals called menaquinones made by the fermentation process could protect against diabetes, and that probiotic bacteria contained in yoghurt could promote a healthy environment in the gut.
Associate Professor O'Brien said it was important to note that the yoghurt eaters in the study tended to be slimmer, more physically active and smoked and drank less, so were a more healthy group than average overall.
""The investigators used sophisticated computer modelling to try and control for all of those other factors, but this is always difficult,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, I believe these results are really important as they build on what we know from previous studies. I already eat yoghurt regularly and I'll certainly be recommending it to my patients from now on.""
La Trobe University dietician Audrey Tierney said that the message was ""to look at the net effect of wholefoods, dietary patterns and healthy lifestyle factors and not only isolated foods, nutrients or behaviours"".

Things go better with a sugar tax
HOW much of your tax money do you pay to fight the rising tide of obesity? As CEO of Diabetes Queensland, I ask this because when we talk of a soft drink tax, politicians and commentators rail against any idea that a new tax might work, or could serve a worthy purpose.
But at Diabetes Queensland and in medical centres, hospitals and doctors' surgeries, the alarm is ringing. Already hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year to deal with this problem, with little effect.
Those hundreds of millions are just the cost to the health system. Being overweight in our society also reduces productivity, destroys our quality of life, undermines our standard of living and diminishes the strong and healthy lifestyle we want to pass on to our children.
Even if we reduced every argument about obesity to its impact on taxation alone, you can see tax costs are increasing quickly while our capacity to pay is slashed.
In 2009, the annual cost in Queensland alone, as calculated by Access Economics in its Cost of Obesity report, was $11.6 billion - that's $11,600,000,000.
However you dress it up, that's a massive penalty we pay again and again. And let's be clear, people represented by groups like Diabetes Queensland do not want this surging problem to continue. We don't want Queenslanders to pay ever-increasing amounts to fund a battle if the battle plan is hopeless.
What we want is the effective expenditure of resources to turn this problem around.
We say defeating the trend to weight-gain in Australia actually means you will pay less tax. But success won't come if our only answer is to lecture people about their lifestyle. We cannot continue to spend even more resources on patch-up measures as the health of so many continues to decline.
In Queensland, we welcome a strengthened commitment by the State Government to chronic disease prevention and the renewed calls to action.
In her most recent report, the Chief Health Officer of Queensland, Dr Jeannette Young, said chronic disease death rates were reduced; but rates of disability caused by chronic disease were increasing.
In Queensland, the lifetime risk of a diabetes diagnosis is one in three. For those obese at 18, the risk is three times as great and a whopping 96.3 per cent of our children don't eat enough vegetables.
A soft-drink tax is a foundation; a starting point from which we can redirect our health efforts from patch-up surgeries to prevention. In Mexico, for example, a tax of just one peso a litre (less than 7c) cut annual consumption of sugary drinks by 9.7 per cent and produced revenue estimated at $1.4 billion.
A strong and effective campaign against obesity can help Australians live longer, more productive lives and relieve their need to carry such a massive burden of cost and ill-health.
A soft drink tax is a message. If you don't want to pay it, drink water. Michelle Trute, chief executive officer, Diabetes Queensland

Weight loss ops prove their worth
Weight loss surgery helps people drop the kilograms and keep them off for at least four years, according to British research.
It also helps them beat diabetes and heart attacks.
Researchers examined almost 4000 patients who had gastric banding or gastric bypass surgery.
They found that people initially lost about 5kg a month for the first four months and then their weight loss continued at a slower rate for four years.
The study results, published in PLOS Medicine, show rates of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attack were also reduced in people who had the surgery.
It is one of the biggest studies to look at the broader health benefits of weight loss surgery.
Researchers said the results suggested that widening the availability of the surgery could provide substantial health benefits for very obese people.
They estimated that its wider use in Britain could prevent or resolve about 93,000 cases of hypertension and 149,000 cases of type 2 diabetes over four years.
More than 17,000 weight loss operations are carried out in Australia each year, with West Australians among the biggest users of the surgery.
WA research last month found that weight loss surgery helped older people, despite their higher risk of complications and longer hospital stays.
The study of more than 2000 patients over the age of 55 found their hospitalisation rates were significantly reduced. 17,000 weight loss operations are done in Australia every year.

Lazaro's Dog rises for heartfelt cause
RUBY Culbertson is just like any other three-year-old - she loves jumping, laughing, singing and hide-and-seek.
But her daily routine is much different to most kids' - blood tests before she eats carbohydrates; up to three injections of insulin a day; trips to the doctor and hospital are commonplace. That's the reality of being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.
Ruby was diagnosed at 22 months after falling ill and being rushed to hospital. But after not responding as hoped to a year of two to three insulin injections daily, she was seen as a prime candidate for an insulin pump: a small, battery-operated device that delivers insulin into her system 24 hours a day.
But mother Kelly said the expensive pump, which had helped to stabilise Ruby's insulin levels and restore her happy nature, was only on loan from a medical company.
Kelly was forced to give up work to care for Ruby and so could not afford private health cover to pay for the $8900 pump. Nor were there any government grants available.
""Fundraising is our last hope,"" said Mrs Culbertson.
So, father Gav is getting his band back together for two special fundraising gigs tonight and tomorrow night.
The Packets, a well-known 1990s punk/pop band on Adelaide's pub scene, have not played together since 2002.
""The other guys have wanted to get the band back together for a while... but I guess this seemed like a great opportunity,"" he said.

Caesareans, diabetes rise
More women are being diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy and more are having births induced or delivered by caesarean, new figures show. While the average new mother is older, the proportion of teen pregnancies is falling. Most women who had babies last year (35.3 per cent) were aged between 30 and 34. The number aged over 45 rose from 224 in 2011 to 268 last year. The Mothers and Babies 2015 report released by the NSW government on Sunday shows the reported rate of gestational diabetes rose from 6.4 per cent in 2011 to 8.3per cent in 2015. The rate of diabetes mellitus also increased from 0.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent over the same five-year period. The rate of spontaneous labour fell from 39.4 per cent in 2011 to 36per cent in 2015 and the rate of induction of labour rose from 26.5per cent to 30.5 per cent over the same period. Diabetes was among the most common reasons for induced labour in 2015. Professor Jonathan Morris, who sits on the NSW Health maternal and perinatal advisory committee, said the increase in women with diabetes in pregnancy was related to changes in guidelines for diagnosis and increased screening. The blood sugar level required for a diagnosis of gestational diabetes is now lower than in 2011.

Organs offer a cure for diabetes 
PEOPLE at severe risks from Type 1 diabetes complications have fresh hope as the Royal Adelaide Hospital starts transplants which effectively cures some people of the condition.
The RAH has been designated a national centre of excellence for the work and will have ongoing funding for the procedures which result in some people no longer needing daily insulin injections.
The procedure - which typically requires pancreases from two deceased donors - will be limited to a handful of people each year classed as being at risk of death from severe and regular hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) episodes.
The low supply of available donor organs will limit the number of procedures, while the risks of side effects from drugs needed to stop rejection of the transplants will also limit the number of people who meet strict criteria where the benefits outweigh the risks.
Under the Islet Cell Transplantation (ICT) procedure, insulin-producing islets from a donor pancreas are harvested then infused into the recipient by an injection. Patients typically require two infusions, each from a different donor, of around 300,000 to 500,000 islets each time. If successful, the islets naturally produce insulin as needed, regulating blood glucose levels.
The procedure has been refined over the past two decades and the RAH demonstrated world class excellence in recent research work funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council which included transplants.
While this funding has since ended, the RAH has been selected as a Nationally Funded Centre (NFC) to deliver the treatment as needed.
The RAH's Professor Toby Coates said the funding program aims to ensure low volume but highly specialised and high cost health procedures are available to all Australians.
""Instead of each state or territory providing a treatment or service for a small amount of patients, NFCs are established in a limited number of sites to provide high quality care to patients from across the country,"" he said. ""It enables the selected hospitals to develop a centre of excellence in these areas, ensuring the patients receive high levels of care in a way that is also cost effective for the health system. Approximately 16 ICT transplantations are expected to take place in Australia in 2013-14, and around four of these are likely to be performed at the Royal Adelaide Hospital."" Susan Czernich, 50, of Para Hills West, received infusions under the RAH research project in 2011 and 2012, after regular attacks of hypoglycaemia left her unconscious and in need of resuscitation. After decades of daily insulin injections since diagnosis with Type 1 diabetes as a 12-year-old, she no longer needs injections.
""It is like a miracle - I am the luckiest woman alive,"" she said. ""I could not sleep in my house alone in case I fell unconscious with an attack. Now I am at a point I actually went scuba diving at Christmas."" Ms Czernich said the anti-rejection drugs were a small price to pay for treatment which has given her independence and ended the need for injections.

Apple tipped to launch diabetes gadget
APPLE 'S next big thing could be great news for the 1.75 million Australians with diabetes, with medical experts saying it could revolutionise the management of their chronic illness.
The giant tech firm is famously obsessively secretive about yet-to-be-revealed products, but chief executive Tim Cook started the rumours when he recently announced he was wearing a prototype device that could measure his blood sugar level without the need for a finger prick, and the company hired a group of bioengineers with expertise in the area. It might take years before Apple is ready to bring the device to market - or it could unveil it as early as Tuesday at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, the biggest event in Apple 's calendar.
Little is known about the device, but it is likely to use optical sensors to shine a light through the skin to measure glucose.
Apple is not the only player in this field. Three years ago Google unveiled a prototype contact lens that could test for sugar levels although Google has not yet brought a product to market. Closer to home, Brisbane-based medical firm Glucotek Inc recently lodged a patent for smart earrings that work as non-invasive blood glucose monitors.

Family takes plunge to help find a cure
CANBERRA'S Rachel Prime had a smile and vivacious personality that lit up a room. Now her family will undertake a challenge just as lively as their daughter, sister, mother and partner to raise money for and awareness of the condition that tragically and unexpectedly cut her life short. Rachel's mother, Dianne, sister, Emma, eldest daughter, Claudia Spencer, and partner, Rhys McLarty will leap from a plane this month as part of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Jump to Cure Diabetes. Mr McLarty came up with the idea to support the foundation in honour of Rachel and will lead the charge when the skydivers jump in teams of two on March 29, landing at The Royal Australian Mint. The day will be formally dedicated to Rachel, who lost her battle with type1 diabetes in February. She was diagnosed just before her 21st birthday, more than 15 years ago. Emma said her sister soldiered on without complaint. Despite managing her diabetes, Rachel's condition took an unexpected turn earlier this year and she passed away at just 36, leaving behind daughters Claudia and Amber, partner Rhys and her extended family. ""I think the common perception is when you get older, maybe in your 60s or 70s, there's potential for your eyesight to fail, you might lose a limb, poor circulation, things like that,"" Emma said. ""I don't think many people actually think death is a very high factor involved and certainly not at a young age."" Dianne said it was important to raise awareness of the seriousness of the condition and money to support the foundation to, hopefully, one day find a cure for diabetes. ""My daughter probably didn't look after herself as well as she should have; she probably took the diabetes a little too lightly"", she said. ""It doesn't matter how old you are, if you have type 1 diabetes, even type 2 diabetes, you need to be aware, you need to do everything you can to remain healthy and control it and look after yourself. She always thought there would be a cure for her and she would be fine and people can't take that point of view. We need to make people aware, to get out there, to raise money to try and find a cure."" Jump for a Cure aims to do just that.

Biotech firm GI Dynamics has raised $57.5 million via private placement from local and offshore investors to help fund a pivotal US trial for its product to treat type 2 diabetes.
GI Dynamics is developing a non-surgical treatment for Type 2 diabetes and obesity called the EndoBarrier, a thin, flexible, tube-shaped liner that forms a physical barrier between food and part of the wall of the intestine.
It received approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in 2011 for sale in Australia and approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for a pivotal clinical trial.
The placement of CHESS Depository Interests (CDIs) had been upscaled to $57.5 million from $35 million due to strong demand from fund managers, with the fresh money split from the UK, US and Australia. There was also some interest from Asia.
It is believed there are 10 new institutions around the globe that have joined the register, including specialist bio-pharma funds from offshore.
Massachusetts-based GI Dynamics, which listed locally in 2011, is still several years away from being profitable. It has snared some big-name investors, including Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and M&G Investment Management - which are believed to have supported the company in its latest fund raising.
Commercial footprint
The new CDIs have an issue price of 53? each, a discount of about 11 per cent to the last close.
The share purchase plan launched aims to raise as much as $2.5 million, with the same price.
""This financing allows us to fully and rapidly resource our pivotal trial in the United States while continuing to expand our commercial footprint and sales ramp in Europe, Australia, South America and the Middle East and build the case for reimbursement in key markets,"" chief executive Stuart Randle said.
More than half the cash will be used for working capital while about $32 million will be used to fund the US clinical trial. The company has already started recruiting for this trial and plans to enrol 500 patients.
However, it will likely be another two years before any data is out.
The EndoBarrier therapy is already available in the UK, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Chile, Australia and Israel. But breaking into the US - the biggest healthcare market in the world - is key to its future success, said Canaccord Genuity life science analyst Matthijs Smith.
""They have launched this product into a number of different markets and data is showing good potential but until they get that US trial data, sales are going to be relatively muted,"" he said.
While Mr Smith backed the novel product, saying it is far less invasive and about half the cost of a Lap-Band, many global regulators will want to see this US data. GI Dynamics is seeking reimbursement in Australia, where patients currently self-pay for the EndoBarrier.
Bell Potter is joint lead manager on the deal. CIMB is co-lead manager while Lazard Capital Markets is acting as US placement agent.

Health wrap diabetes Newman
My niece was 17 when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, just as she was about to start her tertiary education.
It was a life-changing event. She was faced with managing a chronic disease, for which there is no cure, for the rest of her life.
It was also a life-changing event for her parents - my sister and brother-in-law.
They would face a rollercoaster of emotions, from guilt to constant apprehension for the wellbeing of their once completely healthy and sport-loving daughter.
This new lifestyle is not unique. It is the same for more than 1200 families in WA and it is even harder if their child is diagnosed as a toddler.
Parents must learn to anticipate the insulin needs of their infants, a time-consuming and worrying daily practice.
It was about this time that I first started thinking about how we could help families affected by this disease.
The wonderful team at Princess Margaret Hospital do a marvellous job of looking after newly diagnosed kids and preparing them and their parents for the arduous life ahead.
But families must also learn to cope for themselves. This places an immense emotional and physical strain on families.
What if we could have somewhere where these families could get together in comfortable familiar surroundings and share their fears and successes?
Somewhere that not only looked after their clinical needs but also prioritised their emotional wellbeing and connected them with others.
And so the concept of the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre was conceived, and supported by my deputy chairman and former mayor of the City of Stirling, Tony Vallelonga.
After a long gestational period this place is now a reality and thanks must go to Health Minister Kim Hames for agreeing with the idea and making the land available. Once we secured the land, we needed funds to build the centre.
Naturally we looked to The Telethon Trust because Telethon is now the most trusted name in this State and really does make sure that the money you so generously donate every year helps as many children as possible.
The remaining money came from Lotterywest and this, without doubt, is the ""Lotto Dream"" come true for so many families.
Jeff Newman is chairman of the Telethon Type 1 Diabetes Family Centre.

EYE FACTS
Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and the leading cause of preventable blindness among working-age Aussies.
Almost 1.1 million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and more than 300,000 have a degree of diabetic retinopathy. Everyone with diabetes is at risk.
Because damage occurs before any changes to vision are noticed, its essential to have an eye check at least every two years and every three to 12 months if eye disease has been diagnosed.
The longer you've had diabetes, the more important it is to keep getting regular checks, even if previous test results have been clear.
Treatment is effective if its delivered early, and almost all vision loss is preventable.
ANYONE SUFFERING THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS SHOULD BOOK A CHECK-UP IMMEDIATELY
Dark spots or holes in the visual field
Blurred, distorted, dim or double vision
Difficulty seeing at night or increased sensitivity to lights and glare
Frequent changes in glasses prescription
Haloes around lights

Diabetes cost to be in billions
LOST productivity from diabetes will strip $3.4 billion from Australian government coffers in 2030, research has found.
A joint study between universities in Queensland and NSW has predicted diabetes will cost $350 million in welfare payments, $166 million in uncollected taxation revenue, and $2.9 billion in lost gross domestic product by 2030 - up 38 per cent from 2015.
This is on top of the direct healthcare costs of diabetes, which increased from $811 million in 2000-01 to $1.5 billion in 2008-09, or 86 per cent.
The study also found people aged between 45 and 65 with diabetes collectively stood to lose out on $807 million in lost wages by 2030, earning $913 less on average than someone without the condition.
The joint authors of the University of Queensland and University of Sydney study have called for urgent action, acknowledging the true cost of the condition was likely to be ""even larger"" than predicted.
This was because their study did not factor in all expenses including ""informal carer costs"". Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said the true burden of the disease was set to be ""enormous"".

Blood-sugar trial makes life sweeter
Like most children with type 1 diabetes, Lucia Wright dreaded the constant finger pricks to check her blood sugar levels.
But the Scarborough 11-year-old is now part of a trial of real-time continuous glucose monitoring, which can automatically check her glucose levels every few minutes.
A small sensor sits under the skin and sends information to Lucia, her mother and her teacher using an app on their mobile phones.
""Having diabetes is tough because I have to inject insulin up to six times a day and monitor everything I eat to try to keep my blood glucose levels in a normal range,"" Lucia said.
""Being able to use this glucose monitoring system makes things that bit easier. It helps me stop my levels going too high or too low because I know what they are doing and can intervene to help get them up or down.""

Ask the naturopath...
Q + A
A blood test has shown that I have high insulin levels. My doctor says it's a sign I have insulin resistance and could be heading towards type 2 diabetes. What does insulin do? And what can I do to reduce it?
Insulin is a hormone made by beta cells, which are found in the romantic-sounding but rather mundane Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It helps to maintain the blood's glucose levels by controlling the glucose channels and allowing it to cross cell membranes to be used for energy.
Beta cells are destroyed in type 1 diabetes, and without them insulin can't be created. In these cases, insulin needs to be injected into the body.
In the early stages of type 2 diabetes (the most common form), the cells start to resist the hormone's instruction to allow glucose to enter cells, causing blood sugar levels to rise - this is insulin resistance.
CAUSES OF INSULIN RESISTANCE
As well as being linked to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance is also associated with polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, sleep apnoea, high blood pressure and some cancers.
Resistance can be inherited, however, lifestyle factors play an enormous role in causing it, with inactivity and overeating the biggest concerns. Other risk factors include high blood sugar levels, elevated triglycerides (blood fat), ageing and taking certain medications.
HERBS AND MINERALS THAT HELP
Natural ways to lower blood glucose and reduce insulin resistance include herbs such as goat's rue, gymnema, cinnamon, Panax (Korean) ginseng and fenugreek.
Also try supplements of chromium, zinc, magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D, fish oil, alpha-lipoic acid and B-complex vitamins.
EASY LIFESTYLE CHANGES
Muscle contraction improves the uptake of glucose by cells. Muscles contract when you exercise, and 30 minutes daily has been shown to decrease insulin resistance.
Adding certain foods to your daily diet can assist in your body's blood-sugar regulation. Try including legumes, oats, cinnamon (add a teaspoon to your cereal or smoothie), fenugreek, blueberries and bitter melon (bitter gourd). Studies have also shown that soluble fibre enhances insulin sensitivity, as well as slowing the release of sugar into the bloodstream.
Good sources of soluble fibre are fruit, vegetables, legumes, oats, psyllium husks, chia seeds, nuts and seeds.
Avoid eating sugar and refined flour products such as cakes and white bread.
Having a glass of wine with a meal has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.

Final push as Proteomics heads for the boards
A Perth biotech focused on the early detection of diabetes and kidney disease is set to list on the Australian stock exchange before Christmas, with its management claiming to have reached its $4 million minimum.
Proteomics International Laboratories, which is based at the new state-of-the-art Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, will close its initial public offering on Friday as it tries to push towards its maximum $6 million mark this week.
The company, which now employs 20 people, is described by managing director Richard Lipscombe as focused on ""analysing biomarkers"" for diabetes and kidney disease - personalised medicine to enable analysis on how each person adapts to treatment.
""Essentially, our tests also allow us to determine if someone has the disease earlier,"" Dr Lipscombe said.
""It's about looking at the molecular level, before symptoms really appear, and looking at your blood and seeing if these markers are changing.
""We've just completed a high-level, two-year, 100-person study worth $2 million which validated that it works and we're talking to companies about commercialisation at the moment.""
Proteomics is also looking into drug discovery in scorpion and spider venom. Its cash flow stems from conducting tests on generic protein drugs for companies in India.
Dr Lipscombe said the push to go public was a combination of striking while the iron was hot and the higher profile that came with being a public company.
""It was a matter of expansion for us,"" Dr Lipscombe, who has been with the company since its launch in 2001, said.
""In the areas we're involved in there is a huge number of drugs coming off patent, it's a real window for us.""

Mums with diabetes on the rise
MORE than one in 10 pregnant women is expected to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes, following the release of new guidelines that lower the threshold for diagnosis.
At present, doctor guidelines recommend that women with a blood-glucose level of 5.5 mmol/L or above (millimoles per litre) are diagnosed with gestational diabetes. The new guidelines by the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society - which haven't been updated since 1991 - lower this threshold to 5.1 mmol/L or above.
Gestational diabetes occurs in 5 to 10 per cent of Australian pregnancies, with health experts believing the new guidelines will lead to a 30 per cent increase in the number of women diagnosed.
""Gestational diabetes is a very real risk women need to be aware of during pregnancy,"" Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said.
""The new recommended diagnostic level will help shine a light on the true size of the gestational diabetes problem and, we hope, lead to better management and intervention."" The condition carries health risks for mum and baby during pregnancy and birth, and puts them both at a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in future.

Pin-pick free diabetes treatment
AUSTRALIAN researchers are testing a mobile phone device that delivers insulin in a world-first study they hope will help prevent Type 1 diabetics dying in their sleep.
St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne is leading the clinical trial of an ""artificial pancreas"" in which 24 children have a modified Android phone look after their insulin needs, removing the need for finger prick checks.
In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops making insulin, which means the body cannot turn glucose into energy.
Diabetics must manually measure their blood glucose levels via a finger prick or continuous monitor at least four times a day to determine how much insulin they need.
St Vincent's Hospital endocrinologist Associate Professor David O'Neal said this was a ""very rough match"" compared to a healthy body that regulates insulin minute by minute. The mobile device being tested includes an Android phone controller and a glucose sensor under the skin that instructs the insulin pump every five minutes how much of the hormone to dispense.

Men prone to diabetes
QUEENSLAND men are being diagnosed with diabetes at a much faster rate than women, a report to be released today will show.
In the past 10 years, about 3200 Queensland men have been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes - compared with only 2200 women, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report finds.
When it comes to lifestyle-caused Type 2 diabetes, the trend is the same - with many more men than women having to use insulin to treat their condition.
Health experts say there is no clear reason why the condition is affecting men more commonly than women, and further research is needed.
""Researchers don't know what causes it, there is no cure and, similarly, the reason why it affects more males than females is unknown,"" Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said. ""We need greater investment into researching the condition."" AMA Queensland president-elect Dr Shaun Rudd said a sedentary lifestyle for some men might be leading to increases in the rate of men developing Type 2 diabetes.
""Men are catching up with women in the obesity stakes - through a lack of exercise and eating the wrong things,"" he said. Ms Trute said about 65 per cent of Queensland males were overweight or obese, compared with about half of Queensland females.

Speaking emoji
Are pictograms good for your health? A new diabetes program is counting on it, writes Andrew Masterson.
Like belief in imminent Rapture, type 2 diabetes finds its biggest constituency among the poor, the poorly educated and the disadvantaged.
""In the developed world, diabetes is far more prevalent in low-income, migrant and ethnic minority groups, regardless of which country in the world you go to,"" says Timothy Skinner, professor of psychology at Charles Darwin University in the Northern Territory capital.
""Why that's so is an interesting conversation. It's probably a combination of things such as the costs of living a more healthy life; the costs of food and nutrition. But also we know that depression is a risk factor - the daily burdens of lower socioeconomic groups are a problem.""
Globally, according to the World Health Organisation, those burdens have produced more than 422 million cases of type 2 diabetes, causing 3.7 million deaths a year. In Australia, about 1.7 million people are affected.
The linkage of diabetes with people whose choices are severely constrained by history, language and income creates a whole raft of problems - as if having a progressive condition that can lead to blindness, amputation and kidney failure was not bad enough.
Prime among these are difficulties understanding written material about the subject - especially if that material isn't available in an appropriate language - and being unable to grasp the helpful, but not easy, advice offered by doctors.
Indeed, the critical relationship between patient and physician often becomes strained, as each participant fails to understand the other.
""It becomes just nagging,"" said Isabelle Skinner, professor of remote and rural health at Charles Darwin, and Timothy's wife.
""It becomes this embattled place, where the person and the health professional get into this cycle of totally inappropriate therapeutic relationships.""
Earlier this year, responding to the enormity of the problem, the Skinners combined their expertise to create a start-up and launch a diabetes treatment method they hope will prove to be a game-changer for all involved.
Called Emojifit, it is an app that aims for two revolutionary outcomes.
First, it allows each person with diabetes to make his or her own decisions about treatment and management priorities - an approach that conventional wisdom holds to be risky.
Second - and perhaps more significantly - it attempts to do this by the use of emojis and pictograms rather than written text, to give this power to anyone, regardless of literacy level or language.
This turned out to be nowhere near as straightforward as it seemed.
Pictograms have been around for thousands of years - think of Aboriginal rock art, for instance - and emojis have lately flooded digital communications platforms.
Most of the latter, though, didn't express what the Skinners needed - simple images to represent, among other things, food, alcohol, unhappiness, pain, kidney disease, clogged arteries, exercise, medication and erectile dysfunction.
And they needed them to be instantly clear and unambiguous to sick people in the Northern Territory, Azerbaijan and Papua New Guinea, all at once.
To understand the complexity of this challenge, think of the eggplant emoji on your phone. To you it might represent a vegetable. To your neighbour it might suggest a penis.
Even facial expression emojis can be unclear, although there are a handful that translate across borders and language groups.
""The particular emojis we use of the face are part of a validated scale, and they are different from ones that are just funny,"" explains Isabelle.
The validation arises from research done in the 1990s by US psychologist Paul Ekman, who determined that there are six facial expressions common across all cultures. They represent anger, happiness, surprise, disgust, sadness and fear.
""We are only using two of the universal emojis,"" Timothy says.
""The sad one is the obvious one, as we are engaging people with their depression and how this negatively impacts on people's ability to manage their diabetes. We are also using a graded version of this as a marker of confidence, moving from depression to happiness.""
The second universal, he adds, is the ""happy face"", used in the context of praise.
All other emojis and pictograms on the app have been developed by the Skinners, working with an in-house designer. Drafts are run past the project's more than 200,000 Facebook followers.
User feedback is critical. Recently, for example, there was a need to come up with a pictogram representing an insulin pen, a portable injection device used for diabetes management.
Six possibilities were floated to the Facebook group - each involving a cartoon medicine bottle and a syringe. All were rejected, with reasons ranging from: that some could be interpreted as warnings against using the device; or that the medicine bottle looked like it contained poison; or that it was all just too old-fashioned.
The Skinners have, quite literally, gone back to the drawing board. The visual problem is that while the devices function as syringes, most of them actually look like pens - but a pictogram of a pen will very likely be interpreted as something to do with writing.
The issues they are encountering are increasingly common, and ironic.
Pictograms, by definition, function to circumvent language and convey meaning in a visual form. Just what that meaning is, however, turns out to be strongly influenced by culture. Not everyone speaks emoji.
This is despite a rigid classification system for the smiley faces and hands and bits of food and so on that is universally employed across every communication platform.
Each emoji is accorded what's known as a Unicode number. The rendering may differ slightly between Google and Samsung, but Unicode 1F634, for instance, will always be a head with the snores coming out, the pictogram for sleeping.
In 2016, a group of researchers from the University of Minnesota recruited over 300 volunteers and gave each of them several dozen emojis to interpret. The researchers asked whether each was positive, negative, or neutral.
They discovered that interpretations varied, sometimes wildly, 25 per cent of the time. The rendering of U-1F612, for instance, defined as ""unamused face"" was interpreted as ""disappointment"", ""depressing"", ""unimpressed"" and ""suspicious"".
Another, defined as ""blissfully happy"", was interpreted as ""ready to fight"".
""There is an issue regarding the universality of emotions, but what we've been doing is consulting with our social media platform,"" says Timothy.
""We ask our users to identify which pictograms convey the right meaning, but also don't have any other negative associations.
""The social media platform is crucial to engage people in that dialogue. And I envisage that as we engage more people in more countries using the app, some of our emojis will be tweaked and evolve until we have more universality. But the ones we've got at the moment are as universal as we can get.""
Emojifit was built using two design suites owned by Apple and offered free to scientists and healthcare workers. One of the conditions made by the tech giant is that every visual element must have a fallback spoken word function, to enable use by sight-impaired people.
This was particularly useful for a diabetes app, because sight damage and blindness are common symptoms of the disease.
It did, however, throw up a familiar problem, related to the demographics of the condition. Smaller language groups are proportionately more at risk, yet practically less likely to be able to access health information in their own tongues.
Accordingly, over the past couple of months the Skinners have self-funded a quest to find translators for as many Indigenous language groups as possible. Aboriginal communities, especially those in which English is not commonly spoken, are hit disproportionately hard by type 2 diabetes.
Often, notes Isabelle Skinner, the condition is not detected by visiting health workers until blindness manifests.
Unlike most people who enter the world of digital start-ups, the Skinners hold no illusions of growing rich off their creation. That was never the point. ""At the moment it's working on the smell of an oily rag,"" says Timothy.
However, that is the point: it's working. The data is coming in, and the results are being written up.
""Healthcare professionals have the view that if we let people make their own choices, they'll make bad ones,"" says Timothy.
""Results from our app have shown that if you let people go through the process of choosing what they are concerned about and looking at their own risk factors, they actually do make the right choices... that will have the biggest impact on the things they are most concerned about.""

A HbA1c blood test every three to six months provides information on your average blood glucose levels over the previous three months.
Blood pressure: Should be monitored by your doctor at each visit. Lipids: Blood test to measure your cholesterol and triglycerides done yearly, or as advised by your doctor.
Foot check: Checking your own feet each day for such problems as blisters, infected toenails or breaks in skin, plus a more thorough foot check by a podiatrist every six to 12 months.
Kidney function: Both a urine sample and blood test to assess your kidney health should be carried out yearly, or as advised by your doctor.
Eye check: Done by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist or optometrist) at least every two years or as advised, including a dilated eye examination.
Dental check: Six-monthly dentist checks ensure teeth and gums stay healthy. For denture wearers a dental check every 12 months avoids troublesome pressure spots.
Other tips for living with diabetes include making sure you have a flu shot each year and a pneumococcal immunisation and tetanus booster vaccination, as advised by your doctor.

New drug hope for Type-2 diabetics 
DIABETES will no longer be a death sentence for many sufferers, with a drug commonly prescribed to lower sugar levels found to significantly reduce heart problems - the biggest killer of diabetics.
Australian doctors have now been given the green light to prescribe the drug Jardiance to Type-2 diabetics with cardiovascular issues, with the change being hailed as a significant advance in the battle against diabetes.
About 80 per cent of diabetics die from cardiovascular complications such as heart attack. Diabetes medications lower blood sugar, which can prevent complications like blindness and kidney damage, but do nothing for heart health. The Therapeutic Goods Association has now listed Jardiance for use to reduce cardiovascular deaths in diabetics - the first drug to ever offer that benefit.
Sydney cardiologist Andrew Sindone hailed the drug as a ""big advance"" and said a third of his patients had diabetes. ""It's a big epidemic and this change will have a big impact on health,"" he said.
The discovery was made while the drug was being safety tested, with researchers finding it reduced the risk of a diabetic dying from cardiovascular disease by 38 per cent.
Prof Sindone believed the drug would revolutionise management of diabetic patients. He said those on the drug passed about 18 sugar cubes worth of glucose through their urine every day and dropped about 5kg in three months.

Cost of diabetes health strips to rocket
Diabetics will pay 50 times more for strips that help them monitor their blood sugar levels after the government removed the subsidy, raising concerns about more health complications as the condition of those patients spins out of control.
The federal government removed the subsidy on blood glucose test strips for people with type 2 diabetes who are not insulin dependent effective July 1, though there will be a six-month transition period.
It comes after an election campaign in which neither of the two main parties raised substantial policies in preventive health, although the government claimed the growth in health expenditure was unsustainable.
The price for a box of 100 strips will rise from $1.20 to $60 for patients who are not dependent on insulin because their diabetes is controlled.
But diabetic Graeme Macey said many patients would be priced out of the strips under the changes, which would limit their ability to keep their condition under control.
""These are essential for us,"" Mr Macey said. ""I try to control my blood sugars by testing before and after meals a couple of days a week and I watch my diet and exercise because I'm in the lucky group that's not severely affected yet.
""You have to eat good foods and not get extreme readings and the more you disobey the simple rules the quicker the deterioration of your organs.
""But if I and other people like me can control our health, nothing will happen and we will die of old age.""
About 900,000 people with type 2 diabetes are registered with the National Diabetes Services Scheme and more than two-thirds of them are not insulin dependent.
In removing the subsidy, the government followed the recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which found in a review there was little evidence that blood glucose test strips improved glucose control, quality of life or long-term complications.
The Department of Health said the research it evaluated included a 2012 review by the internationally respected Cochrane Collaboration and a Canadian report on optimal medication prescribing.
""The 2013 Review for Blood Glucose Test Strips looked at all available evidence, not just submissions provided by individual clinicians and support groups,"" a spokeswoman said.
Diabetes Australia said the premise of the review was misguided, and measuring the effectiveness of test strips to control blood glucose was akin to using a thermometer to bring down a fever.
""Clinical outcomes and benefits cannot reasonably be expected to arise from the use of a measurement tool,"" the submission said.
The risks of removing access to the strips included hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, delay of treatment and new costs related to those complications.
Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said there had been universal access to the strips for 28 years and no evidence that they were being used wastefully.
""It sends the wrong message,"" Mr Johnson said.
""If the government wants people to take responsibility and it wants them to look after themselves, you've got to give them access to these things.
""The risk is that some people who no longer have access, their diabetes management will suffer and that may have a cost to the health system in the future.""

Sufferer campaigns for teen diabetic clinic

But the 15-year-old says getting help through dedicated adolescent diabetes clinics has helped her stay on top of the condition and not let it rule her life.
Her family is one of many who have rallied behind calls by senior doctors and Diabetes WA to have a dedicated adolescent clinic at the new children's hospital in Nedlands, similar to the current arrangement at Princess Margaret Hospital.

Diabetes diagnosis linked to wealth
PEOPLE living in wealthy areas are substantially more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than those from lower socio-economic areas, a major Adelaide study indicates.
The study in northwest Adelaide and the Le Fevre Peninsula area revealed a dual health-wealth gap.
It found the highest prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was in areas of lower socio-economic status.
But undiagnosed diabetes was much higher in the least disadvantaged areas - notably around West Lakes and beachside suburbs.
The researchers speculated the well-off - particularly ex-smoker men over 50 - may have fallen into a health-wealth trap: as they are generally healthy they don't often see a GP.
They also note GPs may be subconsciously more alert to check for diabetes in obese people from low socio-economic areas.

Kick the carbs to waist away
EXCESS sugar and carbohydrates - not a lack of exercise - are the reason for surging obesity and diabetes rates, and even people whose weight is normal are now at risk, experts have warned.
We should eat fat and protein to cut our risk of diabetes and other health problems, according to a group of experts that includes a cardiologist, a sports scientist and a physician.
The advocates of the low-carb diet - who make their case in an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine today - are the same experts who appeared on a controversial ABC Catalyst program on extreme low-carb diets in November last year.
Sports scientist Professor Tim Noakes and physician and author of the New Atkins diet, Dr Steve Phinney, write: ""Recent research indicates that cutting down on dietary carbohydrate... should be the primary strategy for treating diabetes, with benefits occurring even in the absence of weight loss."" The prevalence of diabetes increases eleven-fold for every 150 extra sugar calories consumed daily, compared to the equivalent amount of calories consumed as fat, they say.
The editorial says up to 40 per cent of those with a normal weight can even have their health adversely affected by the high-carb diet common in modern societies.
A high-sugar, high-carb diet puts them at risk of hypertension, high cholesterol, fatty liver disease and heart disease even though they are not overweight, the experts claim.
The low carb, high-fat diet promoted by the experts forces the body to burn fat as an energy source rather than glucose generated by breaking down carbohydrates.
But those who have tried it claim the first few weeks can cause bouts of flu-like symptoms, lethargy and shaking during exercise.
Current National Health and Medical Research Council dietary guidelines issued in 2013 recommend 30 per cent of a healthy diet should be made up of carbohydrates like bread, wholegrains and legumes, a further 10 per cent of the diet should be made up of fruit, and that fats should only be ""used in small amounts"".
Dietitian Rosemary Stanton, who helped write the guidelines, says a lower carbohydrate diet is good if people cut out cakes, biscuits and sugary breakfast cereals.
Together, these junk foods now make up 35 per cent of our diet, she said. However, she says we should still eat the carbohydrates in wholegrains and fruit. Diets high in wholegrains and fruit reduce the risk of bowel cancer and diabetes, and you won't get all the vitamins you need on the low carbohydrate diet, she says.

Gen Y at great risk of being #gendiabetes
OVERWEIGHT and obese young people have been urged to prioritise their health in the new year, with estimates that up to a third of their diet is made up of ""treat"" foods.
Diabetes Queensland has launched the Turn It Around campaign, urging Gen Ys to cut one junk food from their diet each day, which could see them save just over 10kg of weight gain and $1100 a year.
Nearly 40 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds in Queensland are overweight or obese but this jumps to almost 50 per cent for 24 to 34-year-olds.
""Over consumption can start innocently enough at the beginning of the week with a couple of sweet biscuits with your morning cuppa but by the end of the week you're drinking too much and snacking on chips and burgers,"" Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said.
""In almost 60 per cent of cases a person can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes by cutting back on these types of foods."" She said Gen Y was at risk of turning into ""Generation Diabetes"" with a 63 per cent increase in diabetes in young adults in the past 10 years.
Dietitian Michael Peterman said ""small sustainable changes"" each day add up and it was important for people to ""retrain"" their bodies.
""I see a lot of people who think they might be addicted to sugar. That 3pm sugar pick-me-up is very common but that's a good time to take advantage of a healthier snack."" Plumber Dave Dower, 25, of Carina Heights, indulged in a treat every day but has taken up the challenge. ""Soft drink is probably my weakness, followed by beer,"" Mr Dower (pictured) said.

Research requires a shot in the arm
RACHEL Climie knows her ground-breaking work on diabetes is pretty important. Using new technology, the Menzies Institute medical researcher is discovering the link between blood pressure and organ failure in type 2 diabetes sufferers.
Measuring the body's central blood pressure at the heart - rather than the usual method of measuring at the arm - can determine more accurately whether the brain and kidneys are at risk, she has found.
""It's never been really looked at,"" Ms Climie tells the Sunday Tasmanian. ""You'll be able to go to the doctor and have your central blood pressure measured in future years.
""That blood pressure is more strongly related to the damage so it's going to be a better marker of your risk."" The result will be different types of treatment - blood pressure medication, for example - for sufferers.
The research forms the basis of the 27-year-old's PhD, which was presented to the Institute last week.
But the existing medical research funding arrangements mean it could also be the end of the line for the study.
Ms Climie has about a 14 per cent chance of receiving the money that will allow her to continue her trailblazing work.
She's applied for a four-year National Health and Medical Research Council fellowship in the hope it can take place at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne.
""If I don't get that funding then I don't know what's going to happen,"" she says.
""It's really unknown at the moment."" Even more daunting for those with type 2 diabetes.
Researchers at the Menzies are hopeful legislation introduced by the Federal Government last week to kick-start the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund will begin to remedy the problem.
Originally a bi-product of the unpopular and abandoned GP co-payment, earnings from the fund will inject $1 billion per year into medical research from 2022.
It will begin next financial year with a modest $10 million top-up, rising to $400m over the next four years. With Australia unable to rely on the private benefactors seen in countries like the US, institutes like the Menzies have welcomed the move, which the Government says will double current funding.
An action group of research organisations says that will bring Australia back in line with the OECD average.
Menzies director Professor Tom Marwick says the unprecedented scheme will potentially boost the institute's $19 million income, around half of which is Commonwealth research money.
""We've done well with getting competitive funding and I would imagine we would have a reasonable chance for getting some of these funds as well,"" he says. ""When you consider the increasing costs, it's the only way that we could even keep our current place.
""Unless that happens, Australia's contribution to international biomedical research is likely to fall back just because of the fact that we're flat-lining on the amount of investment at the moment."" Professor Marwick says Menzies is well placed if the new money targets the big-ticket areas that are its focus, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.
""With an ageing population, research is needed to ensure a better return on health dollars spent,"" Prof Marwick says.
Currently, that is around two dollars for every dollar outlaid. ""We're spending billions on these things at the moment,"" he says. ""How could we set up an initiative that would shave the cost of that in some way by changing what we're currently doing?
""What we're doing at the moment is not sustainable."" Budget savings in health will be injected into the fund but it will still need to get past the Senate.
Labor has signalled it is prepared to negotiate with the Government, while the crossbench could throw up its own obstacles. Association of Medical Research Institutes president Professor Doug Hilton last week urged all sides of politics to back it.
""This fund is for all of our futures and will be a fantastic legacy for this Parliament to leave the people of Australia,"" he said.
Securing the funds will continue to be competitive but how the application process will work is yet to be detailed.
Medical research is considered Australia's best ""smart"" export, directly employing 23,000 people.
After eight years of study, Ms Climie is hopeful she won't have to fall back on her exercise physiology qualification or look for teaching work at a university.
She's also applied to continue her research work for two years with the Heart Foundation.
It highlights the precarious existence of the nation's medical researchers, who need to be prepared to move around and forgo secure incomes.
""It's extremely daunting and doesn't make you really want to be working in this field very much,"" she says.
""Some of the brightest young people just move off into other areas.""
How the Medical Research Future Fund will work Established by $1 billion in uncommitted Health and Hospital Fund money Budget savings from health reinvested until the fund reaches $20 billion $20 billion target to be reached by 2020 and preserved in perpetuity $10 million available for research grants in 2015-16 $400 million available for grants over the next four years

Baby stress tests
MELBOURNE doctors are studying whether subjecting pregnant women to invasive monitoring and lifestyle changes after a diabetes diagnosis saves money and results in better health outcomes for mum and baby.
The number of women diagnosed with diabetes while pregnant has jumped by a third in the past year at the Royal Women's Hospital, after the World Health Organisation's change in its classification of the condition.
The UK and US have not adopted the new criteria, which lowers the blood sugar threshold for a diagnosis, but Australia has.
Head of Diabetes at the Royal Women's Hospital, Dr Tom Cade, said while this strict criteria meant more confirmed cases, it was not yet known if this resulted in better outcomes.
""It is more expensive because as a diabetic you get scanned more frequently, you see educators and the dietitian,"" Dr Cade said.
""Often these women have labour induced and interfered with.
""Diabetes can often rule the woman's thinking, so they're more focused about the diabetes than about all the happy parts of a pregnancy."" All pregnant women are offered the oral glucose tolerance test between 26 and 28 weeks' gestation, which requires up to 12 hours of fasting and consumption of a high-sugar drink to track how efficiently glucose is moved from the blood to the body's cells to be used as energy.
The Women's had just over 400 cases in 2014, but that has jumped to about 650 in the past year under the new criteria.
Dr Cade's team will analyse the health outcomes of 1000 mothers and their babies from the 2014 and 2016 cohorts.
The health costs of these procedures will also be measured.
""All the health risks to the baby go up with diabetes,"" Dr Cade said. ""But if we spend more money in preventing a bad outcome, then mum spends less time in hospital, babies spend less time in the nursery and need fewer interventions.
""The outcomes should be better, but we need to test that.""

Type 2 diabetes may go unmonitored as test strips removed from PBS to save $146m
About 500,000 Australians with type 2 diabetes will lose unfettered access to subsidised blood-sugar test strips after Health Minister Sussan Ley took expert advice that they were being wasted.
In a decision that will save taxpayers $146.3 million over four years, diabetics who are not insulin dependent and have their blood-glucose levels under control will be allowed only a six-month supply of test strips on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
It follows a recommendation from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which met to discuss the review in August 2013 and agreed there was limited evidence that self-monitoring of blood glucose improved blood-glucose control, quality of life or long-term complications in people with type 2 diabetes who were not using insulin.
The move is not universally supported. Diabetes Australia told the review that restricting access to subsidised test strips would represent a ""fundamental change to the universal-access rights of Australians with diabetes and must take into account the likelihood of serious and far-reaching risks and adverse consequences"".
Defending the decision, Ms Ley said the recently launched Choose Wisely campaign also had the Society of General Internal Medicine recommend against the prescription of test strips for certain diabetics.
""This is another example of the government's commitment to working with medical clinicians to ensure taxpayers were investing in contemporary, evidence-based medicine,"" Ms Ley said.
""However, the ultimate decision about a patient's individual needs to access these test strips will still remain with their GP and we've put sensible protections in place to deliver this necessary flexibility."" The minister said unnecessary subsidies would continue to be reviewed to allow other new drugs and services to be funded.
To mark World No Tobacco Day yesterday, Ms Ley announced a $60m investment in extending the PBS to cover Crizotinib, which has been used to treat a rare, life-threatening form of lung cancer, costing patients more than $80,000 a treatment.
Ms Ley said the government had made 667 additions or amendments to the PBS since September 2013, compared with 331 during Labor's last term in office.
""The Abbott government has already listed double the number of drugs compared to Labor's last term in office, and in half the time, and that investment is only going to continue to grow,"" Ms Ley said.
""In fact, $1 in every $6 out of the $10 billion taxpayers invest in the PBS every year is now spent on cancer treatments.
""However, meeting community expectations that new drugs will be listed quickly also comes at a significant cost, with taxpayers expected to invest $50bn making medicines more affordable for patients over the next five years alone. ""Ms Ley also released new anti-smoking campaign materials, much of which targets indigenous communities, as authorities work to cut the adult smoking rate to 10 per cent by 2018.

Diabetes drug hope
AUSTRALIANS with type 1 diabetes will be the first in the world to try a new drug that stopped resultant kidney disease in mice.
The new drug is aimed at preventing kidney damage before symptoms of it appear. Up to a third of those with type 1 and 2 diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease, which often necessitates dialysis or a transplant. About 250,000 Australians live with early-stage kidney disease.
A national clinical trial on 142 diabetics with early-stage kidney disease will begin next month.
Monash University's Professor Mark Cooper said colleague Professor Karin Jandeleit-Dahm and her team discovered three years ago that diabetics' high blood sugars activated a pathway in which a NOX enzyme caused damage to the kidneys.
Prof Cooper, the inaugural head of Monash's Department of Diabetes - the first such department in an Australian university - said the team found that blocking this pathway in mice stopped the kidney injury.
Studies showed the drug could also repair diabetes-related eye and heart damage. Swiss biopharmaceutical company Genkyotex is now testing its use in chronic inflammatory diseases of other organs.
Prof Cooper said: ""In the diabetic kidney three things happen: it scars, it gets inflamed, and it leaks the protein albumin.
""We were able to show this drug stopped the protein leaking, stopped the inflammation, and stopped the scarring. It's the scarring, particularly, that causes kidney failure,"" he said.
After being screened with a urine test measuring albumin levels, test subjects will be treated either with the NOX-inhibitor or with a placebo, and then tracked for a year.
The national trial, led by the Baker Institute, is being funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund and the Australian Research Council.
Those diabetics who have developed kidney disease are at a tenfold greater risk of death, and Prof Cooper explained: ""If we can slow down kidney disease, and also reduce heart and eye disease in the diabetes population, it will dramatically improve lifespan and quality of life.
""These people (sufferers of both type 1 and 2 diabetes) can avoid dialysis, have fewer heart attacks, and suffer less blindness,"" Prof Cooper said.
""The potential is great if it works.""

Scourge of diabetes to cost billions
LOST productivity from diabetes will strip $3.4 billion from Australian government coffers in 2030, new research has found.
A joint study between universities in Queensland and NSW has predicted diabetes will cost $350 million in welfare payments, $166 million in uncollected taxation revenue, and $2.9 billion in lost gross domestic product by 2030 - up 38 per cent from 2015.
This is on top of the direct healthcare costs of diabetes, which rose from $811 million in 2000-01 to $1.5 billion in 2008-08, or 86 per cent.
The first-of-its-kind study also found people aged between 45 and 65 with diabetes collectively stood to lose out on $807 million in lost wages by 2030, earning $913 less on average than someone without the condition.
The authors of the University of Queensland and University of Sydney study, published in the British Medical Journal, have called for urgent action, acknowledging the true cost of the condition was likely to be ""even larger"" than predicted because their study does not factor in all expenses including ""informal carer costs"".
Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said the true burden of the disease was set to be ""enormous"", but it wasn't too late to act.
She called on emergency departments to routinely screen for diabetes when testing blood to help identify at-risk patients as part of a multi-pronged prevention approach.
Australian Medical Association Queensland spokesman and endocrinologist Maarten Kamp said type II diabetes was costly for both individuals and the Government, but weight loss of just 5kg to 7kg could reduce the risk of contracting the condition by up to 60 per cent.
""If you're worried about health, you should be worried about diabetes,"" he said. Ms Trute said as of December, 231,464 Queenslanders had diabetes, with a further 100,000 believed undiagnosed.

Remedies by remote
PATIENTS with obesity and diabetes are increasingly seeking advice from health services online.
Health coach Claire Kerslake who runs her business out of Deniliquin 80km north of Echuca says clients from England, Canada, the United States and Australia are embracing her online services.
""Skype has been a real game-changer,"" she says. ""You can literally work with people from anywhere in the world."" The registered nurse and diabetes educator says there is a clearly emerging trend: people are looking for support and accountability in the management of their own health using technology.
Demand is greatest among busy women aged 35 to 50, Ms Kerslake says. ""The people I work with typically don't like where they are with their weight, health or fitness levels, and they need flexibility in the way they can access help. It speaks to the priority people are placing on their health and how busy everyone is."" While many online health consultancies are launched with a plan to serve remote and rural clients who have limited access to health care locally, time-poor city-based folks are ramping up demand.
Natalie Wischer, who launched Australian Diabetes Online Services from Yea, says a lot of her clients live in Melbourne.
""Many are office-based professionals who don't have time to travel to an appointment and then sit in a waiting room to be seen,"" she says. ""They'd rather pay privately and get the information they want when they want it, without leaving their office or home."" Choosing technology and paying privately to access health services may save some of these patients not only time, but money too, because less work time is lost.
Research also shows people learn best when they are ready to receive information, rather than waiting for an appointment made for a future time.
So Ms Wischer, a nurse and diabetes educator, set up her business to run both during the typical nine-to-five workday, and before and after it.
""I wanted to build my service around my clients' convenience, which means being available any time my clients want help,"" she says. ""I use whatever technology suits the client best."" An emailed question or a text can be responded to almost immediately. Ms Wischer became interested in an online business model after living in a remote Aboriginal community and gaining weight following the birth of her children.
She experienced first hand the difficulty of both accessing healthy food and exercising in extreme temperatures in a remote area.
She turned to technology to lose 20kg and has maintained the weight loss ever since.
""I knew diabetes was the perfect condition for management via Skype, phone and text, because you don't really need to be face-to-face,"" Ms Wischer says.
""Clients can give you all the information you need as they have their own glucose monitoring machines and everything else."" Her business has also taken on corporate clients, particularly remote businesses in the mining sector. ""If you have a healthy workforce, you increase productivity and reduce legal risks down the track,"" Ms Wischer says.
Diabetes costs an estimated 10.3 billion annually, including 4.4 billion in care and treatment and about 4.1 billion in lost productivity.
Ms Wischer believes online health consulting will grow and government subsidies for consultations will eventually be introduced.
""The economic costs are huge and about 60 per cent of Type 2 diabetes is preventable, so it makes sense,"" she says.
In the meantime, some private health insurers are allowing patients to be reimbursed for some online consultations, including remote psychological counselling.
Psychology Melbourne's Valeria Zoteyeva often counsels patients with obesity, including those with undiagnosed diabetes, using positive psychology tools.
Consultations are typically done via video.
""With more social isolation, people can turn to food in ways that are often not helpful,"" she says. ""Obesity is frequently a problem, but people typically don't need a lot of help to learn how to take better care of themselves to feel better physically and psychologically."" Austin Health has released a tender for glucose/ketone meters for patient care. The tender closes today.

Charlie Fishenden AGE: 8 Type 1 DIABETES 
After a rocky road to diagnosis, Charlie Fishenden has embarked on a lifelong journey with diabetes. The eight-year-old from Morley was told she had type 1 diabetes in November.
She'd had symptoms on and off for a couple of years which her mother Kym Dabrowski said neither she nor her doctors realised were related to the chronic disease.
""She had a lot of bladder issues, she would go to the toilet constantly for about a week and lose a bit of control of her bladder and then she would be fine for months,"" Ms Dabrowski said.
""We took her to the doctor about that several times... and because of her age, she was about 5 and 6, it was considered developmental.""
About six weeks before Charlie was diagnosed, she started to eat like a horse, having four Weetbix for breakfast and then complaining she was still hungry, and she was constantly going to the toilet and wetting the bed.
Charlie had lost a lot of weight, her breath had acquired an acidic smell and she was falling asleep on the couch at 10am.
Ms Dabrowski said when she googled the symptoms Charlie ticked every box for type 1 diabetes.
""All the puzzle pieces fell together, I couldn't quite believe myself what I was reading so I rang Health Direct and they said to take her to hospital straight away,"" she said.
At Princess Margaret Hospital it was revealed her blood sugars were 35 when they should have been between 4 and 8 and her ketones were 7.8 when they should have been zero. Ketones are a by-product of burning body fat for energy which is what happens when there is not enough insulin to access glucose for energy.
Ms Dabrowski said once she got over the shock of the diagnosis, it was a relief to know it was not something worse, the condition was manageable and that Charlie should be able to live a normal life with some adjustments.
""It was difficult at the start, you don't think you are going to be able to do it, 'My God how am I going to take all this information in?'.""
The family now have a newfound interest in nutrition and the impact of physical activity. Charlie requires eight to 10 finger-prick blood sugar tests a day and four injections of insulin. She's in the process of getting an insulin pump.

ASK THE NATUROPATH...
My uncle has had diabetes for many years. His doctor has said he needs to improve his circulation. Is there anything natural that could help?
When you hear anything about circulation it's usually confined to the big guns: the major arteries, veins and, of course, the heart. These larger vessels branch out into ever diminishing tributaries called arterioles, venules, capillaries and the lymphatics, which are collectively known as the body's microcirculation.
It's these finer branches of circulation, the teensy-weensy blood vessels and lymphatics, that are responsible for the hard yakka of delivering nutrients including oxygen to target tissues such as the brain, liver and muscles, as well as the nerves, eyes, kidneys and the extremities such as your feet.
These latter destinations suffer when circulation is poor, and this is of primary concern to people diagnosed with diabetes (both type 1 and 2), in which decreased microcirculation is a common symptom.
If left untreated, these complications can be dire and may result in leg ulcers, erectile dysfunction, kidney failure or blindness.
HERBS FOR CIRCULATION For hundreds of years, traditional herbal remedies such as garlic, hawthorn, ginkgo, dan shen, bilberry, chilli and ginger have been used to improve circulation. The naturally-occurring chemical nitric oxide also helps to widen blood vessels, improving circulation (see box, above).
In addition to blood flow, the health and integrity of the blood vessel walls, the endothelium, is vital. Injured endothelium increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Herbs and supplements that are helpful in improving endothelial health include: grape seed extract, bilberry, gotu kola, ascorbic acid and quercetin.
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT Exercise, particularly the kind that makes the heart pump harder, improves circulation.
Whether it's walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, do an activity you enjoy regularly.
Yoga poses (asanas) benefit the circulation in other ways. For the pavanmuktasana pose, lie on the floor or bed, hugging both knees in towards your chest; the flexing of both knee and hip joints causes a temporary reduction in blood flow. As you release the pose, fresh blood rushes back to the area, flushing away toxins and providing fresh nutrients and oxygen.
Inverted postures, where the head is below the heart, encourages blood flow to the brain.
You don't need to go to the extremes of a headstand or handstand; instead lie with your legs up a wall, with your bottom and hips raised on a pillow or a rolled-up towel.

Rates of diabetes 1 defying global trend
Australia has bucked an international trend of rising rates of type1 diabetes. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare released on Tuesday suggests diagnosis rates have remained relatively stable. AIHW spokeswoman Susana Senes said the research found new cases remained fairly stable between 2000 and 2011. There were between 10 and 12 new cases per 100,000 people each year. This goes against what is the case in other countries in the world where there has been a rise,"" she said. ""Given we don't really understand exactly what causes type1 diabetes, it is difficult to put a finger on exactly what might be driving a rise or a stable trend."" There were 2367 new cases of type1 diabetes in Australia in 2011. Incidence rates tended to be higher in males than females, and half of all new cases of type 1 diabetes were in people below 18, the report found. The rate in children under age 14 was 23 cases per 100,000, similar to Canada and the US, but higher than the average - 17 per 100,000 - for countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Diabetes ACT chief executive Gil Cremer said there were about 1200people with type 1 diabetes in the ACT, including about 120children under age 16. ""With type 1 diabetes, it is not a condition that can be cured or prevented, and good care for children, their families and carers of people with type 1 diabetes is extremely important - not only to be able to reduce the complications of the condition but also to have a good quality of life,"" she said. ""I think it's important that people understand you don't get type 1 diabetes from an unhealthy lifestyle."" Type 1 diabetes is an auto- immune disease that develops when the immune system destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Its exact cause is unknown but is believed to be an interaction of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. ""Children are the group that have the highest rate of developing type1 diabetes,"" Ms Cremer said.
She said it was a difficult condition for families to manage. ""It's very intrusive and requires monitoring of blood glucose levels - most will monitor six to eight times a day at least,"" she said. ""Most children have four injections of insulin every day. ""There is no other treatment and at the moment, there is no cure."" Ms Senes said the report's findings were an important indicator of what was occurring with type 1 diabetes in Australia. ""It helps us to know what level of services need to be provided for people with type 1 diabetes,"" she said. ""It's very much about monitoring the situation because it's important to know how many people need these services and whether things have changed, and how we sit compared with other countries around the world."" Ms Cremer said the diagnosis rates of type 1 diabetes tended to fluctuate each year. ""Our experience in Canberra is very similar to the rest of the country although sometimes it is said that we are a hot spot in Canberra for type 1 diabetes,"" she said.

Diabetes carries high cardiovascular risk
THERE is a strong correlation between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, with statistics clearly showing people with diabetes are three to four times more likely to develop CVD.
CVD, a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, comes in many forms and has several causes. However the main underlying problem is atherosclerosis, a hardening and narrowing of the arteries caused by a build-up of fatty products on the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to narrowing of blood vessels and blocking of blood flow.
Blockages can lead to heart attack, stroke or peripheral vascular disease (damage to blood vessels typically in the arms and legs).
People with diabetes are up to six times more likely to suffer from atherosclerosis than people without diabetes, and more than 65 per cent of people with diabetes die from heart attack and stroke.
Though the risk of developing CVD is high when you have diabetes, there are many things you can do to keep your heart and blood vessels healthy. Quit smoking, because smoking increases further the CVD risk.
Take all prescribed medications as directed by your doctor. Visit your doctor for regular health screenings of blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose levels.
Becoming more physically active can help to reduce blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose levels and assist in weight loss, but check with your doctor before starting any new exercise program. Maintaining a healthy weight and waist measurement can dramatically reduce your CVD risk.
A healthy waist measurement for men is less than 94cm, and for women, less than 80cm, with the risk of CVD increasing as the waist measure increases. Finally, enjoying a healthy eating plan will also help to reduce your risk of CVD; increase fibre intake, limit unhealthy fats (saturated and trans), enjoy small amounts of healthy fats (polyunsaturated and mono-unsaturated), limit salt and drink alcohol in moderation.

Diabetes fears for the west
HALF the population of Western Sydney is either living with Type 2 Diabetes or has a very high risk of developing the disease, in what has been described as a ""ticking time bomb"" for the state.
Exclusive statistics obtained by the Daily Telegraph reveal almost 130,000 people living across Auburn, Holroyd, Parramatta, Blacktown and the Hills District are battling Type 2 Diabetes while up to 300,000 are on the verge of being diagnosed.
Diabetes NSW's figures cover those living in the Western Sydney Local Health District.
CEO Sturt Eastwood said there were several factors which contributed to the high concentration of Type 2 Diabetes in Western Sydney including a poor urban layout which left people dependent on cars and the trend of ""health deserts"" with little fresh food.
""This will be the number one health burden in five years,"" he said. The figures follow the local health district's move to join forces with Medicare for the region's Western Sydney Stop Diabetes Plan.

Honour for a champion
BUSINESSWOMAN, fundraiser and footy devotee Susan Alberti has been named 2017 Melburnian of the Year.
Ms Alberti AC (right) was honoured for her lifelong work to help find a cure for diabetes.
Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said Ms Alberti had raised millions of dollars for diabetes research but had also given generations of young diabetes sufferers hope that a cure may be found.
""Her commitment to her community and greater Melbourne has made her an inspiration and her legacy will be felt for many decades to come,"" Mr Doyle said.
Ms Alberti, 70, became a diabetes research campaigner to honour the memory of her daughter who died of diabetes-related complications at 32.
She said the award was a great honour and would inspire her to continue her work.
""My commitment to drive better treatment, prevention and a cure for type 1 diabetes is in memory of my daughter Danielle who died a premature death to the chronic disease, as well as the 140,000 other Australians who suffer from it,"" she said. ""I intend to use the next 12 months as Melburnian of the Year as a platform to raise awareness and support for type 1 diabetes, including our wonderful, world-class research community located in Melbourne who are working hard towards a cure."" Ms Alberti founded the ""Walk for the Cure"" around Albert Park Lake, now an annual event that has raised more than $40 million.
Her advocacy and tireless fundraising work in the field also earned Ms Alberti a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2016.
The Western Bulldogs life member has also been a champion of the women's football movement and the VWFL Premier Division Cup is named after her. The award winners were named yesterday at Town Hall.

New laser could help save eyes
A REVOLUTIONARY ""cool"" laser developed by an Adelaide company offers new hope to diabetics facing blindness.
Laser treatment is typically given only when sight loss is significant as it can damage healthy parts of the eye.
But now a new procedure uses a low-heat beam that leaves surrounding tissues unharmed.
Diabetes is a condition in which the body fails to process sugar. One of the most common complications is sight loss due to deposits of sugar causing tiny, fragile blood vessels to form in the back of the eye and then rupture.
The laser seals off these ruptures, called microaneurysms, and prevents them from developing into lesions, which lead to vision problems.
An Ellex spokesman said that in early clinical trials, the device has been shown to be as effective as conventional laser treatment. Lyndon Da Cruz, a retinal eye surgeon at Moorfields Hospital, London, cautioned that more work was needed with the Ellex laser before any conclusions could be drawn. He said: ""It's a promising technology but we need further trials to demonstrate that the benefits are long-lasting.""

Fruit's forbidden in the new diabetes diet mix
IT'S the game-changing diet that will revolutionise life for people living with Type 2 diabetes and could even prevent us from developing the disease in the future.
Adelaide researchers have this week revealed a low carbohydrate, high protein and high unsaturated fat diet is working wonders in reducing the burden of Type 2 diabetes, including significantly lowering medication requirements.
Other benefits show the food plan helped people shed up to 10 per cent of their body weight and improve blood cholesterol levels.
It is based on a $1.3 million, two-year study of more than 100 people by the CSIRO and SA's three major universities. The work was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council.
It reverses the current national health guidelines medical professionals advocate for people living with diabetes, which recommend a low-fat and high carbohydrate diet.
While including regular shopping trolley items like tinned tuna, avocado, chicken, beef, nuts and low-fat milks and yoghurts, the diet controversially omits fruit.
CSIRO principal research scientist Associate Professor Grant Brinkworth said the findings were ground-breaking and could be used as a preventative measure for pre-diabetics, who have abnormally high blood sugar levels and are at risk of diabetes.
""We know that there are 800,000 to one million Australians diagnosed with diabetes and 85-to-90 per cent of them have Type 2 diabetes,"" he said.
""We know that there is just as many if not more people undiagnosed... (this diet) may prevent you from moving to diabetes."" Prof Brinkworth said the new diet plan focused on unrefined carbohydrates and low GI options. ""You would have a good source of lean meats, a good source of proteins, some dairy, some skim milk and diet yoghurt... cheese is also part of the plan,"" he said.
""To get that unsaturated fat up we included things like nuts including pecans and almonds.
""We did include a little bit of bread and cereals but we were focusing on low-carb options like Ryvita crispbread."" Prof Brinkworth said ""people will raise an eyebrow"" due to the absence of fruit in the food plan. ""In our world, fructose is sugar (so) it's going to elevate your blood glucose response,"" he said. ""It's not like people are having an absence of any of the key nutrients they need to have."" For people living with Type 2 diabetes, the diet had huge success.
""The most amazing benefit of the low carbohydrate diet was the (average 40 per cent) reduction in the patient's medication levels, which was more than double the amount than the volunteers following the lifestyle program with the high-carbohydrate diet plan,"" Prof Brinkworth said.
""Some managed to cease their medications altogether and many described the study as life changing."" Prof Brinkworth said he hoped the findings would revolutionise diet plans for diabetics. ""The real need now (is) to reconsider or revise our current dietary guidelines for diabetes management,"" he said.
""All of our health professionals use our guidelines to guide how to manage diabetes (and) research suggests that it's not giving the patient the best diabetes control."" He urged people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes to speak to their GP before changing their diet. ""We're now looking at how we can potentially deliver this new program into the community so we can have wider access to it,"" he said.

Brave Tristan's a little soldier
THE first time Suzie Silva had to inject her baby boy, her hands shook almost as much as he screamed.
""It was so horrible to have to inflict pain and prick such tender baby skin, but I just had to keep telling myself I was doing this to keep him alive."" The Victorian mother had first suspected her son, Tristan, had type 1 diabetes when she looked his symptoms up on the internet.
Her 23-month-old baby was constantly hungry and thirsty, had extreme mood changes and wet his bed.
Her doctor dismissed her detective work as no more than the product of a paranoid parent, but she insisted on a blood test to allay her fears.
""At 11pm the phone rang,"" she said.
It was the pathology company.
""We don't usually contact patients directly, but if you don't rush your son to the emergency department he is in grave danger of having a seizure or falling into a diabetic coma,"" the caller warned her.
The days that followed would involve pinpricks every two hours to monitor Tristan's blood glucose levels and twice-daily insulin injections.
It wasn't until he was three that he asked why he had diabetes. ""It was so unexpected that I had to turn away so that he would not see the tears roll down my face as I answered him,"" she said.
""I told him it was because he was brave."" Managing the condition has become easier as he ages, but she knows that the five-year-old still struggles with his limitations.
""It was heartbreaking to read comments on his kindergarten assessment that 'Tristan often reflects that he hates diabetes'."" Like the loved ones of the 123,000 Australians with the disease, her hopes are pinned on a cure or better treatment.

Extra funding to help families with diabetes 
Life-changing insulin pumps will be within reach for more families living with type 1 diabetes, following an $870,000 federal government funding increase to a program aimed at helping poor people afford them.
The additional money will help another 136 families to buy a pump and help their children with type 1 diabetes have better control of their blood sugar levels.
Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announces the extra funding on Sunday.
Subsidies to help cover the costs of insulin pumps are available to eligible families with an annual income of up to $101,653.
Christine Garberg says receiving an insulin pump for her nine-year-old son Matthew four years ago dramatically improved their family routine. ""It has been a huge change for us. As a family we have more freedom and for Matthew it has meant much less stress,"" she said.

Meds awareness plays key role in diabetes care
MANAGEMENT of diabetes usually involves a combination of healthy eating, regular exercise and medication.
Medication prescribed for diabetes can be taken as a tablet, or given as an injection that is injected just under the surface of the skin into the fatty, subcutaneous layer.
While the aim of diabetes medication is to assist with managing blood glucose levels, they don't all work in the same way.
Medications are grouped into different classes depending on how they work in the body.
For example, some classes of medications work on the pancreas, while another class may act on the kidneys or the liver. Often how the medication works within the body will determine the nature of the side effects that may occur.
While some medications may increase the risk of blood glucose levels falling below 4mmol/L (hypoglycaemia), others may increase the risk of side-effects such as stomach cramps, diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal problems. Some medications may promote weight loss while, for others, weight gain may be experienced.
Some medications are best taken before a meal while, for others, taking them with food may increase their effectiveness or reduce their risk of causing side effects.
There are several injectable medications available for diabetes management. Insulin has been available since the early 1920s, but recently, several non-insulin injectable medications have become options.
Insulin, however, is lifesaving in type 1 diabetes and remains treatment of choice in this population group.
Insulin can also be used in type 2 diabetes, often in combination with oral diabetes medication. When an individual with type 2 diabetes starts insulin, they are still classified as having type 2 diabetes but their diabetes is referred to as type 2 diabetes requiring insulin.
It is important that you stay as informed as you possibly can about all the medications that you are taking, including medications for diabetes. WANT TO KNOW MORE? TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, OR FOR GENERAL DIABETES ADVICE CALL DIABETES SA ON 1300 136 588.

WAGING WAR ON Diabetes 
Living with diabetes can be distressing and depressing, but science is coming to the rescue with new treatments from emerging technology, writes science reporter CLARE PEDDIE
ABOUT 1.2 million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and it's estimated a further 500,000 remain undiagnosed.
The disease has reached epidemic proportions and yet shows no sign of slowing down, presenting massive challenges to a health system that's already struggling to cope.
But help is close at hand, as the efforts of medical researchers, scientists and nutritionists come to fruition.
Tonight at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute in North Terrace, the Australian Society for Medical Research will present the latest exciting diabetes developments in the sold-out public event ""Dinner with a Scientist"".
1. REPLACEMENT INSULIN-PRODUCING CELLS AT THE Royal Adelaide Hospital, University of Adelaide Professor Toby Coates is searching for ""the ultimate cure"" for type I diabetes, new sources of insulin-secreting tissues for transplant.
And tonight he will reveal the latest exciting development: 3D printing replacement insulin-producing (islet) cells.
""It's super cool, but it's early, baby steps,"" he says.
""What we've done is we've taken some cells, we've printed them into three dimensions and we've shown that cells survive... they secrete insulin... What that means is we can exquisitely control where we put them and what other cells we put them with, so we could actually make organs, put the blood vessels in that we need and put the cells in there to stop rejection, all through 3-D printing here in Adelaide."" Yesterday in Melbourne he addressed the Cooperative Research Centre for Cell Therapy Manufacturing Impact Day, where scientists are sharing their results and discussing plans for the future.
The CRC is headquartered at UniSA's Mawson Lakes campus, which means Adelaide is at the forefront of these developments, leading the charge for people with diabetes in Australia and around the world.
Other sources of insulin-secreting tissues include induced pluripotent stem cells, derived from a patient's own stem cells for personalised treatment.
And there have been promising laboratory experiments with pig cells, which Professor Coates describes as ""back to the future"", because pigs were originally used to supply insulin for humans, before the human form could be produced.
2. STEM CELLS FOR WOUND HEALING ALSO involved in the CRC for Cell Therapy Manufacturing is Professor Allison Cowin, regenerative medicine research leader at the UniSA Future Industries Institute.
Her focus is on the ""wounds that form and don't heal"" in patients with diabetes, as a consequence of peripheral neuropathy and poor blood flow.
The chronic wounds often lead to amputations, perhaps first a toe, then part of the foot, then the entire lower limb. And patients usually die within the next five years.
It's a shocking series of events that is motivating an entirely different approach.
Stem cells can be delivered to the wound and then change into the cells that are required to make the wound better.
""We're developing new ways to make wounds heal better, new dressings and new ways to deliver cells to wounds,"" she says.
""I think it's an exciting opportunity for patients who at the moment do not have options, but it's going to take at least a year to do our first human trial, then we're looking at another two to three years before the therapy is available, but we have a company keen to take it forward.""
3. EATING FOR BETTER HEALTH AND NUTRITION SAHMRI nutrition and metabolism theme leader Professor Chris Proud is summarising the latest research on dietary changes that can help people with type II diabetes.
Adelaide scientists have been leading the charge, with CSIRO demonstrating how diet can be used to reduce or eliminate the need for medication.
And at SAHMRI, scientists have shown how intermittent fasting can make a dramatic difference.
""Changing your diet can benefit or even reverse type II diabetes,"" he says. ""It's all a bit controversial but I'll be talking about studies done here in Adelaide and also in the UK, showing how changing your diet to eat less carbohydrates or decreasing your total intake of food or calories can reduce the effects of the disease... of course the time to intervene should be earlier but it's very difficult to get people to change their eating habits, as you can imagine.""
4. FREESTYLE LIBRE FLASH GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM GONE are the days of routine blood glucose testing with sharp lancets and test strips.
Abbott Diabetes Care is selling the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System.
The system relies on a small sensor on the upper arm that automatically measures and continuously stores glucose readings, day and night. It's designed to be water-resistant and worn while bathing, showering, swimming and exercising.
Just wave the scanner over your arm for the current glucose reading, the last eight hours of glucose data and an arrow showing the direction blood glucose is heading.
5. MINDFULNESS ACCEPTANCE COMMITMENT THERAPY Registered nurse Lauren Botting makes an effort to support the mental health and wellbeing of people with diabetes through her mobile service Diabetes Consultancy.
""We're still not addressing that very well as health professionals so that's a big focus of mine,"" she says.
""People get very stressed with diabetes and there's a stigma about obesity and diabetes."" She says it is important to recognise that ""skinny people get diabetes, obese people get it, but not all obese people"" and research is yet to understand the reasons why.
Mrs Botting often finds herself ""picking up the pieces when people are in tears"", having just received a diagnosis of diabetes, feeling they are being judged on everything they put into their mouths.
She believes the practice of ""mindfulness"" and acceptance of the condition through a form of behavioural therapy can make a big difference to people's quality of life. People can ask to see someone who specialises in that area through their GP. Alternatively they can download smartphone apps for about mindfulness such as Headspace, which offers 10 free introductory sessions, or the free app Smiling Mind.

Artificial pancreas for diabetes on way
People living with type 1 diabetes could be free of regular insulin injections, after researchers declared an artificial pancreas could become available within a year.
Those diagnosed with the autoimmune condition need regular insulin injections, sometimes up to six times a day, to compensate for a pancreas that produces little or no insulin. The body needs insulin in order to convert glucose into energy.
The artificial pancreas is able to monitor the wearer's blood glucose levels and automatically adjust the level of insulin entering the body.
Current devices allow insulin pumps to deliver insulin after a reading from a glucose meter.
The University of Cambridge researchers behind the artificial pancreas say the device would ""close the loop"" and combine both tasks.
Roman Hovorka and Hood Thabit reported a positive response from patients in trials, particularly because the device gave them ""time off"" or a ""holiday"" from their diabetes management.
""The system is managing their blood sugar effectively without the need for constant monitoring by the user,"" they wrote in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.
The system works by attaching a smartphone-sized device to the belly of a patient to monitor blood sugar levels. Readings are transmitted to a control gadget attached to clothing, which is linked to an insulin pump to administer the correct dose through the skin.
Insulin requirements vary quite dramatically between and even within individuals. On one day a person could use a third of their normal requirements and, on another, three times that amount.
Developers say the device could also be used by people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
""Closed-loop technologies are... destined to provide a viable alternative for existing insulin pump therapy and multiple daily insulin injections,"" Dr Hovorka and Dr Thabit concluded.
The US Food and Drug Administration is reviewing one of the proposed artificial pancreas models, with approval possible as early as 2017. Britain's National Institute of Health Research has said the device could appear on the market by 2018.
However, some challenges still need to be resolved in the artificial pancreas, including tackling the time it takes for the insulin to take effect. Some fast-acting insulin took up to two hours after injection to reach its peak levels in the bloodstream - which is not ideal for people in vigorous exercise.
The number of adults with diabetes has quadrupled worldwide in under four decades to 422 million, according to the World Health Organisation.
More than 100,000 Australians have developed diabetes in the past year, according to Diabetes Australia, which estimates 1.7 million Australians are living with the disease.

Researchers discover obesity gene
RESEARCHERS could have figured out why some people get fat and are one step closer to developing new drugs which could reverse obesity and treat or eventually prevent type 2 diabetes.
New breakthrough research by scientists at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute has revealed a gene, called the MNK gene, is involved in weight gain.
Head researcher Professor Chris Proud said the gene was present in everyone but its role in obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes was only triggered when a high-fat diet was consumed.
""This is quite a breakthrough,"" he said.
""We had no idea they (the genes) were involved in obesity and type 2 diabetes. ""Normally the MNK genes are not doing anything bad in the body but testing in animal models found they were crucial to weight gain when a high-fat diet was consumed. ""If you become obese you develop inflammation, especially in your fat tissue, and that inflammation is a large part of all these other adverse effects like cardiovascular disease and diabetes,"" he said, adding type 2 diabetes stemmed from the inflammation in fat tissue.

Doctor on quest to treat diabetes-related foot disease
Liverpool Hospital podiatrist Dr Matthew Malone says research he's undertaking is indicating about 60 per cent of patients who present at Liverpool with major foot problems haven't sought prior medical treatment, which partly explains why Malone vividly remembers so many cases.
One patient who arrived at the clinic three weeks after her initial discharge for toe amputation typifies the types of scenarios Malone regularly encounters. She presented with sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection, he says.
""She's had a procedure and not bothered to see anybody after that. We have to rush her down with the medico to the emergency department and the next thing you know, she's in hospital having intravenous antibiotics and we're trying to stabilise her because she's very unwell.""
Malone is the head of department, podiatric medicine at Liverpool Hospital, which is a leading provider of treatment for people with foot problems. Clinic staff see about 350 patients a month, for issues ranging from foot ulcers to infections that require leg amputations.
Malone is also a senior member of not-for-profit medical research organisation the Ingham Institute's newly formed diabetes research group, based at the hospital.
He's working on research projects to determine how to improve clinical outcomes for patients with diabetes-related foot disease. In Australia, the incidence of people losing a leg because of diabetes is one of the highest in the developed world.
""We're basically trying to prevent them from coming into hospital and losing legs,"" he says.
Malone began his podiatry career in 2003. He completed a bachelor of science (podiatric medicine) at the University of Salford (UK) in 2003 and a master of science (podiatric medicine) at the University of Huddersfield in 2011. Recently, he became just the third-ever Australian to receive a fellowship from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow, on the basis of a strong track record in academic publishing, leadership in high-end research and exceptional clinical skills.
At present beginning a PhD, he intends to consolidate the link between the clinical and academic aspects of his role in the next five years. ""I see patients and have hands-on time with them and look at new treatment strategies designed to use on patients to better their outcomes in life. So a good mix of a clinical and academic role and working my way up to being a potential professor is where I see myself in the next five years.""

Poor diets fuel the fire time bomb
Australia will soon have a new No.1 killer, and we can't ignore it, writes Thea O'Connor.

Different shades Type-1 An autoimmune disease causing destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Most cases develop in childhood or early adulthood. Treatment involves insulin injections or pump. Accounts for 10per cent of all people with diabetes.
Type-2 Characterised by the body producing less insulin, or being resistant to insulin or both. Has a strong genetic component that's unmasked through lifestyle factors. Treatment involves a healthy lifestyle and possibly medication. Accounts for more than 85per cent of all people with diabetes.
Gestational When diabetes first occurs during pregnancy. Occurs in 5per cent to 10per cent of pregnancies in Australia. Typically disappears when baby is born but mother and baby are at risk of developing type2 diabetes in the next 10 to 15 years.

Going blind. Getting your leg cut off. Kidneys packing up. Dying of a heart attack. The implications of being diagnosed with diabetes are shocking. Yet it seems many of us keep ignoring the alarm bells, with rates of diabetes soaring across the globe. This disease is big. It's growing. It's scary and it's very expensive. In the next five years, diabetes will become the No.1 one cause of death and illness in Australia, which now has 1.5million people living with the disease, according to Diabetes Australia. By 2025, it's estimated 3million people will be affected. More than 85per cent of all diabetes cases are type-2, which costs an estimated $14.6billion each year, leading to the same serious types of complications as type-1 diabetes. And studies now show young people with the more preventable type-2 diabetes are twice as likely to die from the disease as those with type-1. It's a public health timebomb. Put simply, diabetes is a chronic condition in which a person has high blood sugar. ""The reason we have an epidemic of type-2 diabetes in Australia is because we have all the contributing factors,"" says Professor Greg Johnson, chief executive of Diabetes Australia. ""Sedentary lifestyles, easy access to processed food, weight gain and a multicultural society which includes people from high-risk genetic backgrounds, such as indigenous, Chinese, Indian and the Pacific islands. ""There's no doubt weight gain is a big driver, but it doesn't explain it all,"" Johnson says. ""There are thousands of people with type-2 diabetes who are a healthy weight and have a pretty healthy lifestyle."" As well as those with existing diabetes, another 2million Australians have ""pre- diabetes"", showing abnormal blood glucose levels. About 35per cent to 40per cent of this high-risk group will go on to develop type-2 diabetes in the next five to 10 years, says Professor Jonathan Shaw, associate director of Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. Coming up through the age ranks is a stream of young people being diagnosed with the ""silent killer"". Once called age-related onset diabetes because it was typically diagnosed in people after age 40, type-2 diabetes is now being diagnosed in younger adults, teens and occasionally children, Johnson says. The Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital diabetes clinic typically treats about 50 to 60adolescents with type-2 diabetes at any one time. ""That's been fairly constant over the last 10 years,"" says paediatric endocrinologist Dr Matt Sabin. ""The youngest person I've treated was about 12."" Young people find it harder to control diabetes, Sabin says, which helps explain why they get more complications younger, such as relying on a dialysis machine to support their failing kidneys. HSC student Taylor Eddy, 18, from the Central Coast, was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes last year, after experiencing excessive thirst, headaches, sudden bouts of hunger and dizziness. ""When I was diagnosed I felt pretty down and daunted because I knew it was going to impact the rest of my life,"" Eddy says. ""I was kind of expecting it though, because my mum and grandmother have it, too. We are indigenous so more likely to get it, but I didn't expect it this young. ""I've found it hard to increase my exercise because of the time pressures of HSC, but a lot of sugar has come out of my diet, especially chocolates and lollies, and I eat less now overall and have lost some weight. It's really hard though when all my friends are eating chocolate, but they are very strict on me. So is my nan who I live with. They are my biggest support."" Those at the forefront of tackling diabetes are frustrated by Australia's lack of a national approach, since type-2 diabetes is preventable. ""In research settings, healthy lifestyle programs for people at high risk of diabetes, reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by about 60per cent,"" Shaw says. ""Real world community interventions, with fewer program resources and where participants may not be as motivated, reduce the risk by 30per cent. ""The problem is we can't get enough people into these programs to make a real difference,"" Shaw says. ""And when we focus on prevention in the general population, not just the high-risk groups, it's really hard to make a dent because that group is so large, and because eating and activity habits are so hard to change."" In affluent countries, underexertion and overconsumption become the norm. ""That's why we also need population measures,"" Shaw says. Finding ways to engineer more activity in our lives is one measure Shaw supports. So is taxing unhealthy foods or subsidising healthy foods. ""It's hard to get it right though,"" Shaw says, pointing to other countries' failed attempts. ""When Denmark attempted taxing high-energy foods, the Danes went to Germany to buy their treats instead... In the end though, this will be one of the important strategies that'll actually make a difference."" A hard-hitting approach is vital, says Mike Daube, a professor of health policy at Curtin University, who has spent decades tackling the public health problems of smoking and excessive drinking. ""We've learnt from our experience with the tobacco industry that a bit of goodwill won't do the trick. Expecting the food industry to do the right thing [by not advertising unhealthy foods to children for example], without regulation is pie in the sky,"" Daube says. ""Soft, happy education doesn't work either,"" he adds, pointing to Western Australia's LiveLighter media campaign as an example of what is needed. Recent campaign ads aim to scare people off sugary drinks by showing graphic footage of gurgling ""toxic"" fat surrounding internal organs. ""Drinking sugary drinks is contributing to our expanding waistlines leading to higher rates of heart disease, type-2 diabetes and several cancers,"" LiveLighter campaign director Maria Szybiak says. Australia's consumption of sugary drinks per head of population ranks in the top10 in the world, with Australians guzzling 1.28billion litres in 2012. The main role food plays in causing diabetes is simply through providing too much energy, says Shaw. ""But there's reasonable evidence that sugar sweetened beverages have an effect above and beyond providing surplus calories.""

""They are invariably over a healthy weight, eat too much overall and too much carbohydrate [such as from bread, rice, pasta] at one time.

No time to bury head in the sand on symptoms of diabetes
For such a common condition, diabetes is still cloaked in ignorance, says Caroline Wells
Just over a month ago National Diabetes Week was in full swing and provided the perfect time to talk about diabetes... or did it?
After careful consideration I concluded yes, the week provides a great opportunity to focus the nation's attention on our cause, but in reality we can't think about something as serious as diabetes for one week and then forget about it.
We need to be talking about diabetes as much as we can, because it is surrounded by misconceptions and misunderstanding, which is quite surprising considering how widespread it is.
We need to dispel the myths, we need to rid society of these misconceptions, we need to raise awareness and we need to promote the early detection of diabetes. We need to ensure the care for people with diabetes is timely and we need to support ongoing research.
So much to talk about, so much to do, and we only have one week to do it? It simply doesn't seem right.
There's no time like the present to start talking about early detection of diabetes, both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes doesn't discriminate and is more common than you think. Every year around 640 Australians become extremely sick and end up in hospital with dangerously high blood glucose levels because the early signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes were not recognised in time. Half of these are children and adolescents.
Failure to recognise the early symptoms of type 1 diabetes such as severe fatigue, thirst and weight loss can lead to diabetes ketoacidosis. This is an acute complication which can be life threatening and often requires hospitalisation.
About one in five people who are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes only learn they have type 1 diabetes after presenting to hospital with diabetes ketoacidosis. If not diagnosed in time, type 1 diabetes can be fatal.
Part of raising awareness and the importance of early detection is that ever one should know the ""4 Ts"" of type 1 diabetes: Toilet - are you going to the toilet a lot? Thirsty - are you really thirsty and unable to quench that thirst? Tired - are you more tired than usual? Thinner - have you recently lost weight?
These 4 Ts are pretty simple. By recognising these symptoms, along with providing timely diagnosis and treatment, we can minimise the number of acute complications requiring emergency hospitalisation.
Now let's think about early detection of type 2 diabetes.
Why does the mention of type 2 diabetes turn so many of us into ostriches, burying our heads and hope the problem will just disappear? We all know what this means and type 2 diabetes perfectly fits the ostrich scenario, because type 2 diabetes can be very insidious and downright sneaky.
It is estimated there are up to half a million Australians living with type 2 diabetes who do not know it. We refer to this as silent undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. What is of great concern is that many people with type 2 diabetes will live with the condition for up to seven years before it is diagnosed and by this time, as many as half of all people will have already developed at least one serious diabetes-related complication.
For example, it has been reported that somewhere between one in 10 and one in five people show signs of diabetes retinopathy, leading to blindness. On top of this, at the time of clinical diagnosis of diabetes up to 48 per cent of people can have impaired foot sensitivity - this is an early indicator of the potential for serious foot conditions that can lead to amputation.
We don't want people developing these complications, they are devastating for the person with diabetes and their families as well as impacting heavily on our health care system. These are just some of the reasons why early diagnosis is so important.
Diabetes can be managed, but like treating all health issues, you need to know what you are dealing with first. If you are over 40 years of age make it a priority to talk to your GP about diabetes and your level of risk. It could be a lifesaving conversation.
Here at Diabetes Tasmania we are keen to hear from you. We have specialist staff and a number of programs and support services all specifically designed to help you to live well with your diabetes.
You are not alone, so call us today.

DEMAND CAN ONLY INCREASE
A TSUNAMI of preventable illness will put Queensland's hospitals under unprecedented pressure over the next decade, health groups warn.
Diabetes Queensland and Cancer Council Queensland say a massive injection of funding for early intervention measures will be needed to maintain public confidence in the system. ""If we can't manage the influx of patients with chronic disease, those satisfaction levels will fall quickly,"" Diabetes Queensland CEO Michelle Trute said.
Diabetes-related admissions now account for one in five of all patient nights in our hospitals. ""That has doubled in a decade and will double again by 2023,"" she said.
""It's almost like being overweight has become the new norm. The biggest tragedy is... there's an attitude that 'it will be alright, I will deal with it tomorrow' but tomorrow never comes."" Cancer Council Queensland spokeswoman Katie Clift said: ""With one in three people rating the system as poor or very poor, there are clear signs of heavy demand on the Queensland health system."" The number of new cancer diagnoses was projected to rise by 48 per cent to 2021 - more than twice the rate of population growth.
""Over 90 per cent of deaths each year are due to chronic disease, and research shows a significant percentage of these could have been avoided through healthy living. Public funding for preventive health is therefore critical,"" she said. Key concerns for cancer patients were waiting lists and the fact that treatment was not available at all public hospitals. Tele-medicine initiatives were helping, but could never completely replace the need for the physical presence of medical experts.

Australian-developed drink puts a brake on rapid growth of diabetes 
EXCLUSIVE Australian diabetes sufferers will soon have access to an innovative pre-meal drink, designed by a small Australian start-up, that will help manage the disease.
Developed over the past five years in Melbourne, GlucoControl works as a pre-meal drink to reduce the glycaemic index of a meal by 35 per cent.
Product developer Omniblend Innovation said the drink would be most effective in people with pre-diabetes and well-controlled type 2 diabetes to assist in delaying the progression of the disease.
The World Health Organisation warned this week, in its first global report on diabetes, that the number of people living with the disease had almost quadrupled since 1980 to 422 million adults.
Type 2 accounts for the majority of people living with diabetes globally and is largely the result of obesity and physical inactivity.
One Australian develops diabetes every five minutes - that is 280 Australians contracting the disease every day.
It is the fastest-growing chronic condition in Australia - around 1.7 million Australians have diabetes - and is increasing at a faster rate than other chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.
Arie Nudel, managing director of Omniblend Innovation, said the new pre-meal drink the company had developed to help diabetes sufferers was a ""one of a kind"".
He said pre-meal drinks that had previously been developed had required large protein doses of 55g to 70g and had very strict consumption parameters.
""From a compliance side they were very poor, and people didn't stick to it,"" he said.
""Our technology allowed us through some specific formulations to be able to produce an effective pre-meal drink with only 16g of protein that can be taken anywhere from immediately pre-meal to 30 minutes before.
""It's small, about 155ml when it's mixed, and it's cost-effective. ""That's what makes it now a commercially viable product.
""Plus, it has been validated for many years through clinical trials with hundreds of participants."" The drink, which is designed to be used as part of a diabetes care diet, is presented in a single serve sachet and reconstituted with water immediately before consumption.
Mr Nudel said while GlucoControl was being launched in Australia - it should be available in pharmacies from the end of next week - the company was also in negotiations with parties in China, Hong Kong, the US and some European countries.
""This is a first-world disease of affluent societies and societies that are moving into a growing middle class,"" he said.
""The key markets are China, which has more than 100 million people with type 2 diabetes, and India.
""The interest we have had from overseas, especially out of China, has been highly motivating for us. It's a large opportunity there. We are a little Australian company and we can probably make a fairly big impact internationally given the work we have done."" Mr Nudel said Omniblend Innovation had worked with diabetes healthcare professionals at the Baker IDI heart and diabetes institute in Melbourne, and endocrinologists, to develop GlucoControl.
The product falls under the classification of food for special medical purposes, so it needs to be sold under some supervision, through a pharmacy or a health food store where advice on the product is available.
Omniblend Innovation was rolled out of contract food manufacturer Omniblend, which specialises in protein powder.
Mr Nudel, whose mother has diabetes, said the company started as a team of two, with a little help from outside sources.
""We were working out of offices in our houses, stealing time when we could from the lab and formulators (at Omniblend),"" he said. ""One thing that pushed us along was a lot of the people that used the product in our trials spoke very highly of the product and had good outcomes. We felt it was a winner for a long time.""

DIABETES BLOOD VESSEL DISCOVERY
MELBOURNE researchers are the first to uncover the mechanism that leads to excessive platelets being produced in the blood of diabetes patients, which puts them at increased risk of stroke and heart attack.
The breakthrough finding has led them to identify two promising treatments, fuelling hope that a monthly injection could soon be offered to the 1.7 million Australians with type 1 or 2 diabetes to safeguard the health of their blood vessels.
Platelets, the blood cells in plasma, play a crucial role in stopping bleeding through clotting.
But too many of them can lead to blood clots that cause heart attack and stroke. And while aspirin is a proven blood thinner, it is less effective in those with diabetes because the platelets become resistant to this.
Researchers, led by the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, showed in mice that high blood glucose causes an increased platelet production, and the resulting cardiovascular disease seen in 70 per cent of diabetics.
Lead researcher Associate Professor Andrew Murphy said they used a new type of glucose-lowering drug to successfully control platelets levels.
Further, they found the specific protein, called S100A8/A9, which caused this increased platelet supply in response to high blood glucose.
Associate Prof Murphy said because there was already a drug on the market that worked to inhibit this protein's ability to curb platelet production in the auto-immune disorder systemic sclerosis, it could speed up its approval for use in diabetes.
And there is emerging evidence that it's not just those with chronically uncontrolled diabetes who are at risk. Even occasional short-term dramatic changes in blood glucose - just one uncontrolled day a week - can lead to vascular damage. The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

Summer masks signs of childhood diabetes 
Perth experts are warning parents to be aware of the symptoms of diabetes, after reports of children being diagnosed late.
Doctors are worried that symptoms such as excessive thirst and tiredness can be dismissed as harmless during WA's hot summer months, particularly if children are very active.
WA's peak diabetes funding group Diabetes Research WA said diabetes could be hard to detect in warmer weather and it was important families knew the early warning signs.
Executive director Sherl Westlund said rates of type 1 and type 2 diabetes were rising in Australian children, including a doubling in type 1 over the past two decades.
""Symptoms such as being excessively thirsty and hungry, losing weight, passing urine more and feeling unusually tired can be easier to dismiss in WA's hot summers when kids are more active, so we're urging mums and dads to know the signs,"" she said.
Professor Liz Davis, clinical lead of Princess Margaret Hospital's department of endocrinology and diabetes, said spreading awareness of the warning signs was vital.
""More paediatric cases of type 1 diabetes are diagnosed in winter in WA but educating parents about early warning signs is critical,"" she said.
""We're finding that more of the children being diagnosed are presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a serious condition that results from a delay in diagnosis and can lead to diabetic coma.""
When Sophie Anti was constantly thirsty and losing weight in the summer of 2013, the eight-year-old's parents put the classic symptoms down to the hot weather.
Her mother Carolyn said she felt guilty when Sophie was finally diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
""We have a pool and she was constantly in and out of it, and didn't have much energy, but the doctors said it was probably just a virus and she needed to rest,"" Ms Anti said.
""But she became very unwell, dramatically losing weight in a few weeks, and by the time she was finally diagnosed she was so ill she almost ended up in intensive care.""
Now 11, Sophie has her diabetes well-managed with an insulin pump.
She is helping to raise awareness about the need for continuing research.

Lower risk of diabetes with 'healthy gut' diet
A MEDICINAL diet that boosts good bacteria in our gut may be the key to reducing the risk of type 1 diabetes, one of the most common chronic diseases in children.
For the first time, Monash University-led research has shown a special combination of fibre - that could be taken as a powder sprinkled on food - can stop mice developing diabetes.
Plans are now under way to trial the fermentable fibres that promote gut health in humans with the hope of preventing the autoimmune disease from developing or reducing reliance on medication.
The diet, developed by CSIRO and refined by the university, uses a combination of resistant starches that are broken down by gut bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids - acetate and butyrate.
These beneficial substances, known as metabolites, are emerging as a key part of keeping the immune system healthy.
""We think that metabolites have anti-inflammatory effects and they do remarkable things in every single major disease we look at - cardiovascular disease, food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma,"" the university's Professor Charles Mackay said. Findings from the trial are published today in the journal Nature Immunology.

Diabetic diet test results in
CHRISTMAS is always a minefield of eating and drinking, which can be especially difficult for people with diabetes.
Should diabetics have a low-carb Christmas?
The cornerstone of type 2 diabetes management has always been successful dietary change.
For this reason, current research is heavily focused on low-carbohydrate vs high-carbohydrate diets, and how they affect blood-sugar control.
The latest study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition is the first to compare the two treatments in a large, well-designed clinical trial.
Researchers split 115 obese adults with type 2 diabetes into either a high-carb diet group (53 per cent carbs as energy) or a low-carb diet group (14 per cent carbs as energy) for one year.
Both diets were designed to reduce total calories by the same amount, and both groups underwent supervised exercise sessions three times a week.
All participants lost weight, fat mass, and saw long-term blood sugar level improvements (HbA1c).
However, the low-carb diet group had significantly greater improvements in blood sugar stability, triglycerides, and HDL ""good"" cholesterol compared with the high-carb group.
As a result, the low-carb dieters were much less likely to spend time in high blood-sugar ranges and, therefore, experienced a much greater reduction of diabetic medication usage.
This is the first solid proof that, alongside a healthy lifestyle, a low-carb eating pattern carries additional benefits for type 2 diabetics.
Perhaps a low-carb Christmas is in order this year?
Of course, you shouldn't make any major dietary changes without first consulting with a health professional.

STRESS LINKED TO ADULT DIABETES
MEN with a low resistance to stress when they're 18 are up to 50 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in adulthood, a study has found.
While psychosocial stress in adulthood is associated with a higher risk of the disease, the researchers wanted to find out if the link applied to low stress resilience in late adolescence.
The study, by US and Swedish researchers, was published in the journal Diabetologia.
It examined the cohort of all 1.54 million military conscripts in Sweden during 1969-1997, when national service was compulsory and included most 18-year-old men. To be included in the study, the men had to have no previous diagnosis of diabetes.
They had undergone standardised psychological assessment for stress resilience and were followed up for type 2 diabetes, identified from outpatient and inpatient diagnoses during 1987-2012.
Low stress resilience was associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes after adjusting for body mass index, family history of diabetes, and individual and neighbourhood socio-economic factors.
The 20 per cent of men with the lowest resistance to stress were 51 per cent more likely to have been diagnosed with diabetes than the 20 per cent with the highest resistance to stress.
The study's authors noted that people who are more stressed are also more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity. They suggested that these behaviours could form most of or part of the increased risk of diabetes, but said more research was needed.

New hope for diabetics
A ground-breaking step towards a possible cure for diabetes has been announced by researchers at Curtin University.
The team developed tiny capsules capable of hosting cells, which form artificial organs capable of releasing insulin, acting as replacements for damaged organs.
The senior lecturer of pharmaceutics and biotechnology at Curtin, Hani Al-Salami - the lead author of the research - said his team was the first to produce capsules that could host houses of cells for an extended time. ""With our capsules, you don't have to inject insulin,"" Dr Al-Salami said.
""The cells that produce insulin sit inside the body. It will create a replacement for the damaged pancreas.""
He said it was the first trial to insert capsules into animals without needing extra drugs and surgery. While the research had specifically examined diabetes and replacing the pancreas, it could also lead to treatments for other diseases.
""Any disease that requires a new organ, for example Alzheimer's disease, anything to do with the breaking down of cells, even wound healing, heart attacks or liver damage can be explored further,"" Dr Al-Salami said.

Alarm as nation struck by surging epidemic
Editorial feature My health
Diabetes continues to spread rapidly across our ageing population, writes Carolyn Boyd.
Diabetes is fast becoming the number-one public health issue in Australia and there are no signs that the condition's alarming spread is slowing, says Diabetes Australia's chief executive, Professor Greg Johnson.
""It is absolutely an epidemic, it's fast increasing,"" he says.
Diabetes is a progressive illness that can develop to the need for daily care. ""There is no such thing as mild diabetes. All diabetes is serious,"" says Professor Johnson.
Not all cases of type 2 diabetes - or what has historically been labelled ""adult-onset diabetes"" but is now being seen in younger people and even children - are lifestyle-related as there are also genetic factors at play. However, two in three cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented if at-risk people lost up to 10 per cent of their body weight and took part in half an hour of moderate exercise five days a week.
That's the advice of Sydney dietitian Kate Gudorf, a specialist in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and sports nutrition.
""That's a really big reduction in your risk,"" says Gudorf, who practises at Newtown Nutrition.
Gudorf says there are plenty of things that people not yet afflicted by diabetes can do to reduce their risk of developing it.
""Just eating a healthy diet is very important to reducing the risk,"" she says.
Saturated fats should be minimised. ""They are found in full-cream milk, full-fat cheeses, things like bacon, sausages and butter. Eliminating those from your diet is really important... you want to replace them with healthy fats.""
Healthy fats, or polyunsaturated fats, include fish oil, canola oil, olive oil and nuts such as walnuts and almonds.
Keeping cholesterol and blood pressure at accepted levels and quitting smoking also helps, as does eating a diet high in fibre.
Gudorf suggests including high-fibre foods such as quinoa (which can be cooked in stock and eaten instead of pasta or white potatoes, or cooked and included in salads, used as a porridge or ground and used as a flour in baking), barley and wholemeal breads. Along with fruit and vegetables, legumes also are a good source of fibre.
Rather than trying to follow a strict eating plan, Gudorf recommends making a general switch in the types of food you consume. ""So often in magazines and books, you see an eating plan but it is just very generic and it's not necessarily going to be the right meal plan for [you],"" she says.
""I am a big fan of balanced meals. So something like a sandwich, on wholemeal bread, with maybe lean chicken and lots of salad. For dinner having a small piece of lean protein, like chicken and adding to that lots of vegetables and low-GI [glycaemic index] carbohydrates."" Quinoa and sweet potato are example of low-GI carbohydrates.
There is bad news for the nearly one-quarter of Australians who skip breakfast. ""One of the things I stress over and over to my patients is to eat three regular meals a day - it helps to manage your blood sugar levels throughout the day,"" says Gudorf.
If you're not a breakfast person, at least try to eat within one to two hours of waking. ""Something like a piece of wholemeal toast is the easiest thing in the world to make,"" Gudorf says.
Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic condition in Australia and the number of people affected is set to more than double from 1.5 million to 3.5 million in the next 20 years.
Every day an estimated 275 Australians are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes is a progressive condition that can reduce both quantity and quality of life, and requires daily self-care.
Diabetes costs Australian taxpayers more than $6 billion a year.

Weight fears widen
Desk-bound staff at risk of diabetes
WORKERS must be banned from sitting for more than two hours at a time, according to a health expert who is alarmed at rising diabetes rates.
Professor Jonathan Shaw, whose 12-year study calculates that 269 adults develop diabetes every day, says drastic measures are needed.
His research shows 25-to-34-year-olds are gaining more weight than any other age group and are now 6.6cm wider and 6.7kg heavier than a dozen years ago.
""We need changes to occupational health and safety regulations so it is not allowed for people to sit for two hours at a time without a break,"" he said.
""I think everything should be on the table - taxation levers, town planning, even the layout of office spaces needs to be reconsidered to tackle the growing personal and community impact of chronic disease."" Professor Shaw, from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, has run a 12-year study of 11,000 Australians.
A new report from the study shows people over-estimated the amount of exercise they thought they were doing by 50 per cent.
They said they spent 200 minutes a day sitting but an electronic device recorded they spent an average 500 minutes a day sitting.
The incidence of diabetes is five times higher in people who are obese and two times higher in those who are overweight.
Over the 12-year study, the average gain in waist circumference among participants was 5.3cm and was greater in women than in men.
""The trend for greater weight gain among people aged 25 to 34 is very concerning and suggests Australia still does not recognise the serious health risks associated with being overweight or obese,"" Professor Shaw said.
""The health and wellbeing of a whole generation of Australians is being compromised by a lifestyle rich in energy-dense foods and low on physical activity."" The study also found the prevalence of depression was 65 per cent higher in people with diabetes and they showed twice the rate of cognitive impairment of those without diabetes.
The community needed to get serious about weight gain in the same way it got serious about smoking, gun control and water restrictions, Professor Shaw said.
He advocated a tax on junk food, subsidies for healthy foods, standing desks in workplaces and more accessible stairs to encourage more activity.
A rule banning sitting for more than two hours might not go down well with employers but they should ""look on it as a long-term investment in their employees"", he said.
National Heart Foundation (SA) acting chief executive Wendy Keech said companies were putting workers at risk if they tied them to desks.
""We are lobbying them to systematically introduce things to get all people moving during the day,"" she said.

Discovery fires hopes of halting diabetes 
Monash University researchers have identified a protein which causes pre-diabetes, paving the way for prevention of a disease affecting 1.7 million Australians.
The team, led by Matthew Watt from Monash's Biomedicine Discovery Institute, singled out a protein called Fetuin B, which is present in high levels in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is a precursor to type two diabetes.
About 60 per cent of obese adults have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, placing them at risk of developing type two diabetes.
In patients tested in Melbourne and The Netherlands, the protein was shown to impair the actions of insulin, providing an explanation, and a potential therapeutic target, for a major cause of diabetes.
The researchers discovered, initially in mice prone to diabetes, that the protein was only present in high levels in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which were also pre-diabetic or diabetic.
When the scientists reduced the Fetuin B levels in the liver and blood of the obese mice, they became more sensitive to insulin. In human trials, volunteers who were obese but not diabetic did not have high levels of Fetuin B.
Professor Watt said scientists had previously thought diabetes was caused by being fat, rather than the way in which fat was stored in the body. ""What we're now finding is that it's the storage of fat in the liver which creates the problems and causes the proteins secreted in the liver to change,"" Professor Watt said.
""The important part of the story, from a public health perspective, is that even if you're not fat, you can get fatty liver, mostly from a poor diet, and that can lead to diabetes. By developing a drug that could block this protein, it may be possible to prevent the development of diabetes in patients with fatty liver.

 ""A sudden swollen foot revealed my diabetes; days later I was almost blind""
Susan Harvey, 65, thought her swollen foot was the result of an insect bite. When doctors gave her the correct diagnosis, her life was turned upside-down. She tells her story to Beverly Hadgraft
""My mum was in her 60s when she got diabetes.
I exercised regularly and rarely needed more than a pill for a headache, so I thought to myself, that will never happen to me.
I cared for Mum until she died, and I'd hit my 60s by the time I woke on Australia Day 2009 with my right foot as big as a balloon.
I couldn't walk on it, so I called a taxi and got myself to hospital.
I told the doctors I must have been bitten by something as they took blood tests and did X-rays.
But it turned out to be something much worse than that.
I had type 2 diabetes. The swelling in my foot was due to osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone. Osteomyelitis of the foot is apparently surprisingly common in diabetics. I had two broken toes and hadn't even realised because of the damage the diabetes had already caused to the nerves in my feet.
I was put on a very strong antibiotic drip and insulin. I felt quite stunned. However, there was worse to come.
While I was in hospital, I'd buy a newspaper every day. However, a few days into my treatment, I picked it up and couldn't see the print. It was just a grey blur.
""I can't read the paper!"" I said to the nurse and she told me not to worry, and that my vision would come back in about six weeks.
A doctor gave me the same reassurance and I now realise that, back then, people didn't realise that diabetes puts you at high risk of eye disease.
It wasn't until I'd left hospital and seen a diabetes specialist that I was sent to get my eyes checked. Finally the diagnosis was confirmed: I had an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy.
My high glucose levels had led to damage to the blood vessels in the back of my eye.
The treatment freaked me out.
I had to have needles in my eye every month. I also needed laser treatment in my right eye, then three lots of surgery to control the bleeding at the back of both eyes.
I had to have my right cataract done and my left one will also need treatment, as early cataracts are also common in diabetics.
The specialist eventually said that my eyes had been so badly damaged there was nothing he could do to restore my vision.
I live by myself in my Sydney home and was very frightened that I might go completely blind. The surgery was especially distressing.
It was around that time that I reached out to the Macular Disease Foundation Australia for help. They were so kind and helpful. I've ended up volunteering three days a week for them and I've found it a great comfort.
Fortunately, my sight has been preserved sufficiently that I can still read with my left eye with the aid of magnifying glasses.
I can also do my own shopping, although I have to bring things right up to my face to read the labels.
However, I've lost the ability to do simple pleasures such as knitting or sewing.
I'm still only 65. The diabetes is now under control but I so wish I'd gone for regular eye tests before this point. I thought my eyesight was fine so I hadn't visited an optometrist in years. I'm sure if I'd done so, they would've seen what was happening at the back of my eyes and perhaps diagnosed my condition earlier.
At least I can tell my story now and, hopefully, it will remind others to have an eye check at a minimum every two years, especially if they are or even think they could be diabetic.
I can't emphasise that enough.
Look at me - I'm paying dearly for what I didn't do.""
EYE FACTS
Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease and the leading cause of preventable blindness among working-age Aussies.
Almost 1.1 million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and more than 300,000 have a degree of diabetic retinopathy. Everyone with diabetes is at risk.
Because damage occurs before any changes to vision are noticed, it's essential to have an eye check at least every two years and every three to 12 months if eye disease has been diagnosed.
The longer you've had diabetes, the more important it is to keep getting regular checks, even if previous test results have been clear.
Treatment is effective if it's delivered early, and almost all vision loss is preventable.
ANYONE SUFFERING THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS SHOULD BOOK A CHECK-UP IMMEDIATELY
Dark spots or holes in the visual field
Blurred, distorted, dim or double vision
Difficulty seeing at night or increased sensitivity to lights and glare
Frequent changes in glasses prescription

THOUSANDS of Australians with type 2 diabetes will soon be able to have one injection a week instead of 14, saving themselves $1600 a year under a new Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing.
Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley will today announce that the new diabetes treatment Exanatide will be listed on the taxpayer-funded PBS, improving the lives of up to 20,000 Australians.
The $70 million announcement on revolutionary new medicines to be listed on the PBS will also include breakthrough treatments for cervical cancer and other life-changing illnesses. But the new diabetes treatments are expected to be cost-neutral because they are alternatives to existing treatments.
""As one of our most prominent chronic diseases, type 2 diabetes is placing a significant cost on the nation's health and finances, at nearly $1 billion per year,"" Ms Ley said.
""According to Diabetes Australia, there were about 4000 amputations last year that could have been avoided with better daily management of a patient's condition. Our hospitals also saw over 900,000 diabetes-related admissions."" The PBS gives millions of Australians access to subsidised lifesaving drugs. In further announcements to help diabetes sufferers, linagliptin and linagliptin with metformin, as well as vildagliptin and vildagliptin with metformin, will also be available under the new September listings, giving patients additional treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The drugs are used to lower blood-sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. By saving money on some drugs through a range of methods, including using generics and driving harder bargains with drug companies, the Federal Government will spend $60 million to list bevacizumab on the PBS for the treatment of persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer where surgery and radiation are not viable.
""Our announcement will help save the lives of over 200 Australian women who aren't responding to conventional treatments for their cervical cancer, and therapy was previously out of reach at $55,000 per course of treatment,"" Ms	 Ley said.
""They will now pay just $6.20 per script if they're a concessional patient or $38.10 if they're a general patient.
""However, these breakthrough medicines also come at a significant cost to taxpayers and we must be able to pay for them."" The drugs will be on the PBS from September 1.

Diabetes desk threat
SITTING at your desk for more than two hours at a time is such a health hazard it should be illegal, a leading expert insists.
As his new study reveals 269 Aussie adults develop diabetes every day, Professor Jonathan Shaw says drastic measures were needed.
""We need changes to occupational health and safety regulations so it is not allowed for people to sit for two hours at a time without a break,"" he said.
""I think everything should be on the table - taxation levers, town planning, even the layout of office spaces needs to be reconsidered to tackle the personal and community impact of chronic disease."" Prof Shaw, whose AusDiab study analysed the health of 11,000 Australians over 12 years, found those aged 25-34 were packing on the kilos more than any other age group.
The average waistline expanded by 5.3cm over the course of the study - while participants overestimated the amount of exercise they did by more 50 per cent.
People also self-reported they spent 200 minutes a day sitting down. But an electronic device recorded they spent an average 500 minutes sitting.
""The trend for greater weight gain among people aged 25-34 is very concerning and suggests Australia still does not recognise the serious health risks associated with being overweight and obese,"" Prof Shaw said.
""The health and wellbeing of a whole generation of Australians is being compromised by a lifestyle rich in energy-dense foods and low on physical activity."" The incidence of diabetes is five times higher in people who are obese and two times higher in those who are overweight.
Living in our most disadvantaged areas further doubled the risk, the study found.
Prof Shaw is backing a tax on junk food, subsidies for healthy foods, standing desks in workplaces and making stairs more accessible to encourage physical activity.
He said banning workers sitting for more than two hours might not go down well with employers, but they should ""look on it as a long-term investment in their employees"".
For Hatice Akgul, 25, of Auburn in NSW, having diabetes in her family was a ""wake-up call"". Ms Akgul lives with her uncle Ertugrul, who developed type 2 diabetes early in her life.
""It makes you think 'Could I get this?' - especially now that I work behind a desk and I'm not as active."" she said. ""I have to make an effort every day to get outside and get moving.""

BB King rushed to hospital
Blues great BB King has been rushed to hospital in Las Vegas, where he has been admitted.
The 89-year-old guitarist, a 17-time Grammy winner and consistently cited as one of the 20th century's greatest guitarists, was suffering from a ""diabetes-related emergency"", according to entertainment website TMZ. He is said to be suffering dehydration.
King's admittance to hospital was confirmed to the Los Angeles Times by his representatives, although no updates were given on his condition.
King is famed for a heavy touring schedule - he performed more than 200 times a year for 50 years - but cancelled the remainder of his performances in 2014 after a fall on stage at the House of Blues in Chicago.
Earlier in 2014, King was heckled after giving an erratic performance in St Louis, which he blamed on not taking his prescribed Type 2 diabetes medication.

 If white teeth and fresh breath aren't enough motivation to do as the dentist advises and floss and brush twice a day, perhaps evidence that poor oral health is associated with a growing list of medical conditions will do the trick.
Gum disease also known as periodontitis has a well-proved link with diabetes. However, associations have also been noted with a number of other chronic health conditions.
Periodontal disease causes gum tissue to separate from the teeth, opening a gateway for harmful oral bacteria to enter the bloodstream. Symptoms include red and swollen gums, bad breath, receding gums and loose teeth. Smoking, conditions such as diabetes, old age and genetics all increase the risk.
It may be that periodontal treatment, which can be as straightforward as scaling and root planing, where the teeth are cleaned above and below the gum line, or in advanced cases surgery, is not just helping keep mouths healthy but may offer a means of preventing and improving the prognosis for other conditions.
A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine earlier this year indicated just that. The analysis of insurance claim data from 330,000 people in the US found those who were diagnosed with one of the identified conditions, had periodontal disease and had received periodontal treatment five years previously experienced statistically significant reductions in medical costs and hospitalisations for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cerebral vascular disease than those with periodontal disease who were not treated.
The strongest evidence of the link between oral health and another medical condition is with diabetes. And the association goes both ways - those with diabetes have more severe periodontal disease and periodontal disease can itself be a cause of exacerbated symptoms of diabetes. A Cochrane review of all data found a small but significant improvement in the blood sugar levels of diabetics after treatment for periodontal disease.
While there is evidence of an association between poor oral health and a number of other conditions including heart disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes including pre-term birth, lung conditions and possibly rheumatoid arthritis, many of the conditions share underlying risk factors and more research is needed to prove (or disprove) causal links.
Australian Dental Association WA spokeswoman periodontist Jane McCarthy said a common theme for many of the conditions where there was an association with periodontitis was inflammation and immune disregulation.
Treatment of gum disease was simple and the sooner people sought help the less chance there would be for irreversible damage. However, many people were not seeking treatment when they should. ""Healthy gums don't bleed, full stop. If people's gums bleed then they need help and if they go to the dentist and they have some treatment and they still bleed they need more help,"" she said.
""Tooth loss is not inevitable at all, the gums heal very quickly when appropriate treatment is applied,"" Dr McCarthy said. ""If gums still bleed then further treatment is required and specialist referral should be considered.""

Sugary soft drinks linked to diabetes risk
THE link between sugary soft drinks and diabetes has been demonstrated again in a study that found just one sweet beverage a day significantly increased the risk of developing the disease.
But those who consume diet drinks and pure fruit juice can breathe easily after the study found no clear link between those beverages and diabetes.
Previous North American studies have already found that consumers who drink a sugar-sweetened beverage each day increased their risk of developing type two diabetes by 25 per cent.
Researchers from London's Imperial College studied the soft drink consumption of 28,000 Europeans and found drinking one 336ml sugary soft drink increased the risk of developing diabetes by 22 per cent.
""Given the increase in sweet beverage consumption in Europe, clear messages on the unhealthy effect of these drinks should be given to the population,"" study author Dr Dora Romaguera said.
The researchers looked at the soft drink consumption of residents from the UK, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy and the Netherlands who are participating in a broader study into cancer and nutrition.

Health Type 2 diabetes would be slashed Sugar tax call backed by study
Calls to impose a controversial sugar tax in Australia have been bolstered by a new study led by researchers from the Australian National University.
The study, performed in Thailand, suggested that thousands of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented every year by cutting out sugary drinks.
Lead author Keren Papier, from ANU's Department of Global Health, said the findings could be applicable in Australia.
""A reduction in sugary drink consumption is likely to reduce rates of diabetes in Australia,"" she said. ""Several countries, including Mexico, the United States, France and Chile, have already started acting on sugary drinks by imposing or committing to a sugar tax.
""Findings from the US and Mexico show that applying the tax has led to a 17 and 21 per cent decrease respectively in the purchase of taxed beverages among low-income households.""
The results came from the massive Thai Cohort Study, which analysed a nationwide sample of almost 40,000 adults between the years of 2005 and 2013.
Using a statistical technique called mediation analysis, it showed that diabetes risk increased as more sugary drinks were consumed.
""Sugary drinks are an ideal target for public health interventions to help control the type 2 diabetes epidemic since they have no nutritional value and do not protect against disease,"" Ms Papier said.
""Over 4000 cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented annually in the Thai population if people avoided drinking sugary drinks daily. Thai women, who are at double the risk of type 2 diabetes from drinking sugary drinks, would be the main beneficiaries.""
The sugar tax concept has divided opinion both in Australia and overseas. In February, Assistant Health Minister Dr David Gillespie squashed the idea of introducing a sugar tax.
""Cut to the chase: the thing with all of the proponents of sugar taxes, fat taxes, whatever tax, is taxes will make people angry and it won't change what they eat,"" he said.

Diabetes eating young
THE number of Queenslanders diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes before the age of 40 is growing, with new data showing younger people are increasingly being identified with the condition.
National Diabetes Services Scheme data, obtained by Diabetes Queensland, has found an increasing number of Sunshine State residents are being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in their 20s and 30s.
In total, 194,852 Queenslanders are registered with the federal service. Most are in their middle or later years.
But Diabetes Queensland chief executive Michelle Trute said while the rate of diagnosis among older aged groups had plateaued or declined, Type 2 diabetes was growing among people in their 20s and 30s over the past few years.
""More and more young people are checking to establish their risk of diabetes and an increasing number find their danger is real,"" she said. The NDSS data, seen by The Courier-Mail, shows 45 Queensland children under the age of 16 were also registered with the condition, which is predominantly caused by lifestyle factors.
Ms Trute said in 60 per cent of cases of Type 2 diabetes progression could be slowed or even halted by treatments, such as diet and exercise improvements, especially when diagnosed early.
University of Sydney human nutrition professor Jennie Brand-Miller said limiting incremental weight gain, which can creep up on adults, was the best way to prevent diabetes.
She said adults should not to put on more than 10 per cent of their young adult weight.
""They might only gain a kilo a year, they might let their belt out, they might buy slightly bigger clothes... but the trouble is, it is all incremental and it adds up to 10kg in 10 years.""

ASK THE NATUROPATH...
Q+A My uncle has had diabetes for many years. His doctor has said he needs to improve his circulation. Is there anything natural that could help?
When you hear anything about circulation it's usually confined to the big guns: the major arteries, veins and, of course, the heart. These larger vessels branch out into ever diminishing tributaries called arterioles, venules, capillaries and the lymphatics, which are collectively known as the body's microcirculation.
It's these finer branches of circulation, the teensy-weensy blood vessels and lymphatics, that are responsible for the hard yakka of delivering nutrients including oxygen to target tissues such as the brain, liver and muscles, as well as the nerves, eyes, kidneys and the extremities such as your feet.
These latter destinations suffer when circulation is poor, and this is of primary concern to people diagnosed with diabetes (both type 1 and 2), in which decreased microcirculation is a common symptom.
If left untreated, these complications can be dire and may result in leg ulcers, erectile dysfunction, kidney failure or blindness.
HERBS FOR CIRCULATION For hundreds of years, traditional herbal remedies such as garlic, hawthorn, ginkgo, dan shen, bilberry, chilli and ginger have been used to improve circulation. The naturally-occurring chemical nitric oxide also helps to widen blood vessels, improving circulation (see box, above).
In addition to blood flow, the health and integrity of the blood vessel walls, the endothelium, is vital. Injured endothelium increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Herbs and supplements that are helpful in improving endothelial health include: grape seed extract, bilberry, gotu kola, ascorbic acid and quercetin.
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT Exercise, particularly the kind that makes the heart pump harder, improves circulation.
Whether it's walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, do an activity you enjoy regularly.
Yoga poses (asanas) benefit the circulation in other ways. For the pavanmuktasana pose, lie on the floor or bed, hugging both knees in towards your chest; the flexing of both knee and hip joints causes a temporary reduction in blood flow. As you release the pose, fresh blood rushes back to the area, flushing away toxins and providing fresh nutrients and oxygen.
Inverted postures, where the head is below the heart, encourages blood flow to the brain.
You don't need to go to the extremes of a headstand or handstand; instead lie with your legs up a wall, with your bottom and hips raised on a pillow or a rolled-up towel.

Diabetes 
Diabetes can be silently undermining your health for a decade before you're diagnosed.
Most people discover it by accident such as after a heart attack or a random blood test.
Unfortunately, by the time you experience the classic signs of diabetes - fatigue, excessive thirst, blurred vision and frequent urination - it has already begun to affect your body.
""We find those symptoms are very easy to ignore for most people, they are quite vague and you can attribute them to other factors - 'I'm quite tired at work', 'I'm thirsty because it is hot' - so they are very easily and often ignored,"" Diabetes WA educator team leader Rebecca Flavel said.
In the pre-diabetes stage there was already an elevation of glucose levels that could lead to changes in some blood vessels.
Ms Flavel said it would be dangerous to wait for symptoms and those at high risk of the condition should be checked by their GP.
People over 40 and overweight, who have a history of cardiovascular disease or gestational diabetes and those aged over 35 from a Pacific Islander or Asian background were all at greater risk of diabetes.
""If someone has some large blood vessel disorders such as heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure or have experienced a stroke - we know they are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes,"" Ms Flavel said.
""Early diagnosis of diabetes gives you an opportunity to reduce or delay any of the complications that are associated with type 2 diabetes, which are heart disease, kidney and eye damage and nerve damage.""
Ms Flavel said while you could not change your age or genetics, type 2 diabetes could be delayed or prevented by adopting lifestyle changes that result in weight loss.
A reduction in body weight of 7 per cent can reduce your risk of developing diabetes by 60 per cent.
Early diagnosis of diabetes gives you an opportunity to reduce or delay any of the complications that are associated with type 2 diabetes, which are heart disease, kidney and eye damage and nerve damage.

Lap-band not just for obese
OVERWEIGHT people are undergoing drastic weight-loss surgery, usually reserved for the severely obese, to cut their risk of diabetes.
Some doctors are now so convinced by the effectiveness of lap-band surgery, they are calling for it to be available to anyone weighing over 80kg.
""The reality is for the vast majority of people non-surgical intervention is not effective, it doesn't achieve sustained weight loss that can put diabetes into remission,"" says Dr John Wentworth.
He has led a study by Monash University's Centre for Obesity Research that found people who were overweight and had the surgery lost an average 11kg.
A paper to be presented at a conference of diabetes specialists in Sydney this week shows these patients required significantly less medication to control their diabetes, with more than half entering diabetes remission.
Those who didn't have the surgery but were put on a diet and exercise plan achieved a weight loss of just 2kg and required intense medication to manage their diabetes.
The average starting weight of the 51 patients who took part in the study was just 81kg.
Current guidelines say the surgery should only be performed on those with a BMI of 35 or above - or weighing more than 110-115kg.
Christine York, who weighed 90kg and had developed diabetes, volunteered for the trial nearly four years ago.
She lost around 25kg, plunged from a dress size of 18 to 12 and now weighs 63kg. Her diabetes is in remission.
""It made me realise you can change your life,"" she said.
""I even got married last year and wore a decent wedding dress, not a sack."" Her previous attempts at dieting had resulted in weight loss of just 4 to 5kg. Dr Wentworth said it would be wrong to see his study as a business building opportunity for obesity surgeons and he said the research was unable to give an explanation for why only half the patients' diabetes go into remission. ""We don't know why it didn't work for the other 50 per cent, we don't fully understand it."" About 17,000 Australians a year undergo surgery to control their weight and studies show that 10 years later, patients have put back on just a third of the weight they lost. Lap-band surgery is expensive, however. It can cost up to $15,000 and requires patients to commit to a lifestyle change. It is also not without risk, with one in eight suffering an ""adverse event"" and it can cause gastric reflux and vomiting.

THE HEALTHY TRUTH
Diabetes linked to risk of dementia People who have diabetes and experience high rates of complications are more likely to develop dementia as they age than people who have fewer complications, according to a new study.
 The research, published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, suggests blood sugar control can prevent decline in mental ability.
 An individual develops diabetes when the pancreas doesn't produce enough of the hormone insulin or the body can't use insulin properly to process sugar.
When blood sugar levels remain high due to uncontrolled diabetes, serious complications can develop, including blindness, kidney failure and decreased blood flow in limbs, which can lead to amputation.
The nationwide, 12-year, population-based study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database's records, dating back to 1999 to identify 431,178 people who were older than 50 and newly diagnosed with diabetes.
The researchers reviewed records to determine how many people in the cohort were admitted to a hospital or had at least three outpatient medical visits for dementia after they were diagnosed with diabetes.
Among the people in the survey, 26,856 people (6.2 per cent) were diagnosed with dementia. The risk of dementia was higher among people who had a high score on the Diabetes Complications Severity Index than for those who had a low score.

Each day, 280 Australians are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes - the leading cause of kidney failure and vision loss in people of working age.
Professor Jonathan Shaw said: ""We're facing a tide of people with diabetes. If we can discover new mechanisms, that may lead to a new drug or new way of preventing a complication."" He said the study would look beyond factors detected via blood test, also examining behavioural and psychological factors.
""We know some of the reasons why people progress to complications, such as their levels of blood sugar and cholesterol,"" Prof Shaw said.
""But it's still generally hard to say who will progress quickly, and therefore should get more attention now, and who's looking pretty safe."" Data will be collected from patients biennially, ranging from diet, lifestyle and cognitive tests, to medication adherence, genetics and cholesterol. Eye scans can show disease progression.
Heart scans will help determine causes of new complications such as heart failure. Frozen blood and urine samples will allow future tests to be conducted on this population.

SUGAR Nazis rejoice - a new study shows every sugar-sweetened drink you give up each day will cut your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 25 per cent.
Sweetened milk drinks such as milkshakes have also emerged as a greater enemy than the much-maligned soft drinks in type 2 diabetes risk. But tea, coffee and juice drinkers can take heart because it turns out some sweetened drinks are better than others.

A Cambridge University study found replacing a serving of soft drinks with a serving of water or unsweetened tea or coffee cuts the risk of diabetes by 14 per cent. And replacing a serving of sweetened milk beverage with water or unsweetened tea or coffee cuts diabetes risk by 20 to 25 per cent. The most recent Australian health survey in 2011-12 found one in four Australians was eating at least 100g of total sugars per day. This is at least 23 teaspoons of naturally present or added sugars.

Focus on babies for a cure to diabetes
NEWBORN babies could help scientists pinpoint the triggers of type 1 diabetes. The biggest study of its kind in the southern hemisphere will investigate why prevalence of the auto-immune disease has doubled in the past two decades.
It is believed that children are exposed to triggers in the environment for the disease as babies, or while they are still in the womb.
Royal Melbourne researchers are part of the national team investigating whether exposures during pregnancy - the mother's nutrition, diet or microbes - could explain why some babies develop the disease and others do not.
The 1600 babies, who have relatives with the auto-immune disease, will be examined over three years to find ways to prevent the disease.
In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the pancreas cells that produce insulin, which regulates the conversion of sugars in food into energy.
The research will focus on islet autoimmunity, which is an underlying auto-immunity to insulin-producing cells, that can be detected in the blood stream before symptoms of type 1 diabetes start.
The research team want to determine the environmental factors that trigger it. Victorian woman Kim Bush has enrolled her baby, Zachary, 10 months, in the trial.
The type 1 diabetic suffered numerous diabetes-related complications during her pregnancies and lost three babies.
She is desperate to help researchers because she knows how taxing it can be relying on daily insulin injections and constant blood tests.
""The research is critical because it could lead to prevention or a cure,"" Mrs Bush said.
""I would just urge anyone to take part in this trial because it's vital not just for your children, but for your grandchildren and their grandchildren."" Royal Melbourne Hospital Diabetes and Endocrinology Director Professor Peter Colman said he believed that environmental exposures during pregnancy through to early childhood could be the key to understanding the development of the disease.
He said more than 122,000 Australians suffer from type 1 diabetes, but the incidence increases 3.2 per cent a year.
Pregnant women from South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and NSW with a first degree relative with the auto-immune disease are being recruited for the trial.

Your dentist can spot diabetes
Dentists can identify people with type 2 diabetes, even those in the early stages with glucose metabolism problems, just by looking at the health of their gums.
Periodontist Jane McCarthy, who has sent many people to their GP for glucose tolerance tests because their mouth health indicated they were likely to be diabetic, said there was a bi-directional relationship between gum disease and diabetes, with some studies indicating a three-fold increase in periodontitis for those people with diabetes.
""When they get a periodontal defect it (accelerates) really quickly so they end up with a particular pattern of attachment loss and also inflammation. The inflammation doesn't look in a lot of cases in line with how much plaque there is, there is an exaggerated response,"" she said.
There is some evidence that chronic periodontal infections can lead to glucose intolerance and poor glycaemic control and that treatment can cause a small but significant improvement in blood sugar levels.
Diabetes WA education services manager Deb Schofield said the link between periodontal disease and diabetes was well established.
""We know that people with diabetes have a higher risk of developing gum disease than those who do not. There is also some evidence that suggests that in serious cases - as gum disease is a type of infection - it can have a negative impact on blood glucose levels, which of course a person with diabetes needs to manage carefully,"" Ms Schofield said. ""That's why it's important for people living with diabetes to visit their dentist regularly for advice on self-care and to receive regular preventive maintenance to keep their teeth and gums healthy, along with early intervention should problems occur.""

There is a big difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes other than the lack of insulin. They don't know what causes type 1 diabetes. There is a genetic disposition and they think there is probably a viral trigger but they have got no idea.
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation [JDRF] was present from the first hours after Will's diagnosis. One of the things that has worked for me and Janine and Will is that we have really tried to understand the disease as best we can, and how to treat it. One of the interesting factors about type 1 is that it is an auto-immune disease.
Among the problems of growing up with type 1 diabetes is if you don't look after yourself, you can damage key organs.
As the chair of JDRF, I want to hold this job for the least amount of time ever because [that would mean] they've found the cure. I am really optimistic that the quality of therapy for type 1 diabetics is going to dramatically improve: an insulin is being developed that will only release when it is required.
Everyone told us when Will was diagnosed there would be a cure in 10 years. Well, we are 10 years on. I would say the advancements have been phenomenal, the treatment is way better but we still have a way to go.
The incidence of type 1 is increasing. We don't know why. Hopefully I can lend some weight to the great work [JDRF managing director] Mike Wilson and the team are doing.
I attended a fantastic session at Davos chaired by [US Vice-President] Joe Biden. He lost his son to brain cancer. There was a panel of eight people, some of them were cancer specialists, there was the chief executive of Cisco, one was a molecular scientist. They all said they wanted better access to the data.
One of the great things that is coming from big data is that all of a sudden people are seeing remedies or issues around a particular disease apply to others. There is a quid pro quo here. If we as a community provide more funding, then it doesn't matter if it is child cancer, diabetes, Crohn's disease, whatever.
If we provide more funding then the research institutes have to get their act together in terms of common languages and sharing data. The capacity we have now to crack some of these things is amazing. It's a multiplier of what it was 10 years ago. I think that is really exciting.
Ian Narev
Co-chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation advisory board.
The Commonwealth Bank CEO was introduced to the work of the foundation by his predecessor at the bank, Ralph Norris. He chairs the advisory board that convenes annually and includes Telstra CEO Andy Penn, University of Sydney chancellor Belinda Hutchinson, UBS chairman Matthew Grounds, Macquarie CEO Nicholas Moore, Monash University chancellor Simon McKeon, Translational Research Institute CEO Ian Frazer, SingTel director Peter Mason, Contact Energy chairman Ralph Norris, Nine Network Melbourne managing director Jeff Browne and National Australia Bank director Phil Chronican.
When I took over as chief executive from Ralph Norris there was a discussion of all the different things that involve the bank and the CEO personally and you try to carry on as many of them [as possible].
I went to a couple of JDRF discussions and thought it was an extremely well managed, well run organisation doing very important work, so I carried on and I'm pleased that I did.
Two things grabbed me.
Number one, you hear the personal stories, and for those of us who are parents you inevitably go, ""What if it were my child?"" Secondly, you see the numbers [2300 people are diagnosed every year and the number is rising].
So it's a combination of the personal stories, which wake you up and you think, ""Gosh this is really tough,"" the numbers that show you the magnitude of it, and then just the feeling that there is stuff that can be done and can make a real difference.
On the one hand you sort of feel like, ""There are a lot of people all around the world going after this [cure]. What are we going to add?"" But on the other hand, I think Mike Wilson has done a sensational job of running the foundation. They have good medical experts involved, and they have good fundraising and corporate support. You genuinely sense a real belief that it could make demonstrable progress.
I don't see these things as, ""I'm being a hero contributing my genius to the organisation.""
By exposing yourself to different problems, to different people, to different approaches you are bringing ideas and creativity back to your day job which you don't get from being focused on just the run-of-the-mill stuff you do every day.
Mike Wilson
JDRF managing director (pictured left)
In the last federal election, pretty much the only health policy that had bipartisan support was a commitment to support diabetes technologies, advocated for by JDRF.
JDRF exists to rid the world of type 1 diabetes, and along the way make life with the disease a bit safer and easier every day.
Doing this is not easy, so JDRF has worked hard to build a plan and a team of the people who can help deliver on it. For us this has also meant building a high-quality board and advisory board.
The way we see things, the term non-profit should describe a financial outcome, not a management style. Richard, Ian and our other directors bring real credibility to JDRF.
When your chairman is the managing director of Wesfarmers, the chief executive of Commonwealth Bank chairs your advisory board, and your treasurer [Stuart Green] is treasurer of the Macquarie Group, people tend to accept that your governance is under control and you can move straight to the important conversation of how to work together to make the biggest impact as quickly as possible.

Diabetes, loss of hearing linked
THE relationship between diabetes and hearing loss has been debated for many years, but a recent Canadian study has shown that hearing loss is twice as common in people with diabetes compared with those without.
While it is unclear how diabetes is related to hearing loss, it is thought that high blood glucose levels associated with diabetes may cause damage to the small blood vessels in the inner ear, similar to the way diabetes can damage blood vessels in other parts of the body, like the eyes and kidneys. Other evidence suggests diabetes may cause changes to the nerves in the ear, in a similar fashion that diabetes can cause damage to nerves in the hands and feet.
Since it can happen slowly, the symptoms of hearing loss may be hard to notice. Family members and friends sometimes notice the hearing loss before the affected person.
While a person with impaired hearing may still be able to detect that something has been said, the ability to decipher the actual words is compromised, particularly in a noisy room. The sound appears muffled, requiring a greater level of concentration to hear what is being said, hence an increased mental effort that overworks the working memory in the brain.
Quality of life is ultimately affected and recent research has suggested a link between the development of dementia and hearing loss. Signs of hearing loss include frequently asking others to repeat themselves; trouble following conversations that involve more than two people; thinking that others are mumbling; problems hearing while on the telephone or in noisy places (e.g. restaurants); and turning up the TV or radio volume too loudly.
While diabetes management includes regular health checks of the eyes, kidney and feet, hearing assessments are often overlooked. It is important that people with diabetes have their hearing checked regularly by a hearing specialist (audiologist). The assessment is quick and simple and may be the first step towards improved hearing. DIABETESSA.COM.AU, 1300 136 588

Diabetes risk spreads to young; Health experts fear a type two epidemic
HEALTH experts have warned that type two diabetes, an affliction previously confined to over 50s, is spreading to children younger than 15, with 200 such cases reported nationally just the tip of the iceberg. A couple of these confirmed cases are in Canberra while there are 30 in Victoria and more than 80 in New South Wales. Diabetes Australia chief executive Greg Johnson said it was worrying that these figures were likely to be underestimates. His organisation compiled the numbers of registered diabetes sufferers late last year and the statistics revealed an epidemic among younger Australians. These are numbers you wouldn't have seen 10 or 15 years ago, he said. The number of people younger than 50 with type two diabetes across the country is equivalent to the population of Nowra in NSW or Warrnambool in Victoria. There are 25,000 Australian sufferers aged 30 to 40, 5000 aged 21 to 30 and 1000 younger than 20 plus the couple of hundred early teens facing a life of uncomfortable symptoms. From tiredness to itching and skin infections to blurred vision, headaches and leg cramps, the life of a type two diabetes sufferer is not easy. Type two diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes, a name no longer relevant, does not allow the pancreas to create enough insulin for the body to work properly. It can often be managed with healthy eating and regular physical activity but, over time, most people with type two diabetes will also need tablets and many will also need insulin. Mr Johnson said there were 1.05million people with diabetes in Australia but another 2 million to 3 million adults about to get diabetes although, for many, this could be avoided it if they changed their lifestyles. The federal government is investigating the need for front-of- pack food labelling and Diabetes Australia is also pushing for the reduction of junk food ads targeting children.

Revolt over medicine review Diabetics in fear of cuts
DIABETES patients, doctors and drug companies are in revolt over a government review of Type 2 treatments they fear will strip them of access to some tools and medicines.
More than 1.5 million Australians have diabetes and it is poised to become the number one disease burden in the next five years.
The government is looking at ways to control the $600 million a year it spends on products to combat the problem. Already a government committee has found taxpayers could save $50 million a year if it stopped supplying blood glucose strips to Type 2 diabetes patients who don't use insulin.
Another review is looking at who gets access to insulin pumps and a third review is examining the use of Type 2 diabetes medicines.
The Advertiser has obtained a letter signed by 18 medico, research, consumer and pharmaceutical groups that expresses ""serious concern"" the reviews will focus only on cost-effective use of medicines. ""Ultimately, if the Diabetes Review serves only to cut expenditure on diabetes treatment it will have failed to deliver on its potential to advance the clinical management of diabetes,"" the letter says.
At the heart of their concerns is their claim that current guidelines on diabetes treatment are not up-to-date.
Bizarrely, the group also complains about the government's price disclosure process, which ensures the government pays the market price for drugs. This process has generated around $1.3 billion in savings that can be used to fund new medicines and cut the amount general patients pay for drugs.
""We need a new treatment algorithm. We are falling behind because there are more medicines available in other countries,"" Diabetes Australia chief Greg Johnson said.
A government review has found a large proportion of the prescriptions supplied through the medicine subsidy scheme for a new class of diabetes medicines, called gliptins, ""do not meet the criteria for PBS subsidy"".
Three other diabetes medicines are also being given to patients outside the rules of the subsidy scheme and this could provide scope for the government to tighten access to them.
""As glitpins are much more costly than sulfonylureas, use outside of the current PBS restrictions is unlikely to be cost-effective at the current prices,"" the government review found.
But Diabetes Australia says patients need individualised treatment plans that include new medicines as their diabetes progresses, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
A Department of Health and Ageing spokeswoman said post-market reviews of medicines are conducted through an established and transparent process, which includes open public consultation.
