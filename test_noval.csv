Her ſtature is fomething under the middle ſize; but her ſkin is beyond deſcription.—We ſhall preſent	 our cuſtomers, with a few anecdotes of this heroine.— As ſoon as ſhe was turned of thirteen, ſhe felt the early touches and deſires of nature, and was determined	to indulge them the firſt opportunity that offered; but being then at a boarding ſchool near town, ſhe was under great difficulties from the confinement of the place and cloſe inſpection of her conduct; and after being diſappointed in ſeveral well laid ſchemes, and tired with unſocial pleaſures, ſhe fell into a ſort of melancholy, which drew on a ſlight fever; her guardian, being alarmed for her health, removed her from the boarding-ſchool to a genteel lodging at Hampton-Wick, in order to try  what effect the air would have over her diſorder.—In the ſame family mily lived Mr. G— Sh—y, a young gentleman whoſe father had placed him there for the recovery of his health, he having ſome time before had ſeveral ſymptoms of an aproaching conſumption which ſome attributed to too great an application to himſelf, though it was more than probable it proceeded from his exceſſive attention to learning at a private academy.—As they not only lodged, but boarded, or rather made part of the family, and the good people of the houſe being charged with them, they were highly pleaſed with the mutual and tender politenſs they ſhewed to each other; and ſo little did they dream of any harm, that they were frequently permitted to take a walk together round Buſhy Park, or any other place they choſe.—Miſs L-e had often obſerved the reſpectful glances and eager attention Mr. Sh-y paid her on the moſt trifling occaſions, which, from the	natural partiality and good opinion the ſex has of itſelf, ſhe conſtrued into a paſſion. One morning, the weather being very fine, as they were taking their uſual uſual walk in the Park, Nature whiſpered ſoft deſires to them both, while Cupid on one ſide, and Venus on the other, marked them out for mutual inſtructions to each other.---Mr. Sh-y would ſometimes ſteal a kiſs from her, for which ſhe gently reprimanded him, and told him, he was vaſtly rude and naughty: on this he affected to drop a tear;  but ſhe, kind and good natured creature! would give him another kiſs, to reconcile the affront, and diſpel his pretended grief. At length, growing more bold, and ſhe leſs reſerved, he not only offered to thruſt his hand in her boſom, but even to draw the curtain of modefty.--She raved at this inſtance of violence, and by way of ſhewing his repentance, he threw himſelf on his knees, kiſſd her hand, moiſtened it with his tears, and put it into his boſom that ſhe might ſeel how his heart throbbed for fear he ſhould not obtain her forgiveneſs; this had ſo great an effect on her, that ſhe not only pronounced his pardon, but mingled her tears with his, and after the kiſs of peace was given on both ſides, they went home again arm in arm, as if nothing had happened. The next evening they took another walk into the  Park, and as they ſat under a reverend oak, (the confident of many a tender declaration of love) he threw his hand amourouſly about her neck, and ſaid, “My dear girl, we are made for each other;” and gave her the moft animating and delicious kiſſes; while almoſt vanquiſhed, and yielding to his deſires, he ſlily conveyed into her virgin hand the ſtately maſter-piece of nature, which ſo far electrified her, that ſhe fell, as if in a trance, with her hand on his ſhoulder; but preſently recovering herſelf, and alarmed by the laſt remains of modeſty, ſhe broke from him, and running with precipitation into a thicket at a little diſtance, ſome briars got hold of her cloaths, unforrunately tripp'd her up, and ſhe fell gently on a bed of fern, which accident the young gentleman immnediately improved, and after a faint reſiſtance on her her part, enjoy’d conſummate happineſs.When the ſtorm of love ſubfided, ſhe burſt into a flood of tears and aſked him “how he dared he uſe her ſo?” to which he replied in the moſt ſoothing tone, That ſhe was ſo charming, it was impoſſible for him to have done otherwiſe. After ſome alcercation on both ſides, as a proof of their ſincerity and love, they vowed on their knees to be conſtant to  each other, and returned home greatly delighted with the evening’s adventure. The effect of the laſt night’s encounter was ſo great next morning at breakfaſt in both their countenances, that all the family began to prognoſticate the return of their health, ſince ſo ſudden a change had happened in them for the better. In ſhort, they contrived matters ſo artfully, that almoſt every night, when the family were in bed, the young gentleman ſtole to her chamber, and rioted in all the exceſs of love.  Some time after, the father receiving information of his ſon’s recovery, he ordered him home, and this put an end to the amour, not much againſt his inclination as he was quite tired of the conſtant drudgery Miſs L--­ exacted from him. She remained at Hampton Wick but a few days after her paramour, and was placed in a good family in London by her guardian; and, as ſoon as ſhe was of age, received the money left her by an uncle, which was only 300 l. which ſhe ſoon ſpent; and her guardian dying, ſhe was left deſtitute.
