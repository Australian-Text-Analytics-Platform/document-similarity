  The Document Similarity is a tool that you can use to
  identify similar documents within your corpus. Once you
  identify those similar documents, you can decide whether
  to 'keep' or 'remove' them from the corpus. This tool is
  very useful for cleaning up your corpus and removing any
  duplicates or similar documents before you continue with
  your research.
